       " '\\n(Being a reprint from the Reminiscences of JOHN H.\\nWATSON, M.D., Late of the Army Medical Department.)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of\\nLondon, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for\\nsurgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to\\nthe Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was\\nstationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan\\nwar had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced\\nthrough the passes, and was already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed,\\nhowever, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and\\nsucceeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at\\nonce entered upon my new duties.\\n\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing\\nbut misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the\\nBerkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was\\nstruck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed\\nthe subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous\\nGhazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my\\norderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely\\nto the British lines.\\n\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I\\nwas removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at\\nPeshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk\\nabout the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck\\ndown by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life\\nwas despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I\\nwas so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should\\nbe lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\\ntroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my\\nhealth irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to\\nspend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\\n\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air—or as\\nfree as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to\\nbe. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great\\ncesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly\\ndrained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading\\na comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had,\\nconsiderably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances\\nbecome, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and\\nrusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration\\nin my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my\\nmind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious\\nand less expensive domicile.\\n\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the\\nCriterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I\\nrecognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight\\nof a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed\\nto a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of\\nmine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be\\ndelighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me\\nat the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.\\n\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in undisguised\\nwonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. “You are as thin as a\\nlath and as brown as a nut.”\\n\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the\\ntime that we reached our destination.\\n\\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to whether\\nit is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man to-day\\nthat has used that expression to me.”\\n\\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\\n\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was\\nbemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves\\nwith him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his\\npurse.”\\n\\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the\\nexpense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being\\nalone.”\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You don’t\\nknow Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care for him as a\\nconstant companion.”\\n\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his\\nideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a\\ndecent fellow enough.”\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up\\nin anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has\\nnever taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory\\nand eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would\\nastonish his professors.”\\n\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\\n\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\n\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I should\\nprefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand\\nmuch noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for\\nthe remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?”\\n\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either avoids\\nthe place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like,\\nwe shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.\\n\\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me\\na few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a\\nfellow-lodger.\\n\\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know nothing\\nmore of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the\\nlaboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\\nresponsible.”\\n\\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It seems to\\nme, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you have some\\nreason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s temper so\\nformidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”\\n\\n“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a laugh.\\n“Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches to\\ncold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the\\nlatest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply\\nout of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To\\ndo him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness.\\nHe appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.”\\n\\n“Very right too.”\\n\\n“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in\\nthe dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre\\nshape.”\\n\\n“Beating the subjects!”\\n\\n“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it\\nwith my own eyes.”\\n\\n“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”\\n\\n“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you\\nmust form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we turned down a narrow\\nlane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the\\ngreat hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we\\nascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with\\nits vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a\\nlow arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\\n\\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low\\ntables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and\\nlittle Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one\\nstudent in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work.\\nAt the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of\\npleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve found it,” he shouted to my companion, running\\ntowards us with a test-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is\\nprecipitated by hæmoglobin, and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold\\nmine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.\\n\\n“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.\\n\\n“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I\\nshould hardly have given him credit. “You have been in Afghanistan, I\\nperceive.”\\n\\n“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.\\n\\n“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is about\\nhæmoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?”\\n\\n“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but\\npractically——”\\n\\n“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don’t you\\nsee that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!”\\nHe seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table\\nat which he had been working. “Let us have some fresh blood,” he said, digging\\na long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a\\nchemical pipette. “Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water.\\nYou perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The\\nproportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt,\\nhowever, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.” As he\\nspoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops\\nof a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany\\ncolour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.\\n\\n“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child\\nwith a new toy. “What do you think of that?”\\n\\n“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.\\n\\n“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So\\nis the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if\\nthe stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the\\nblood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now\\nwalking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”\\n\\n“Indeed!” I murmured.\\n\\n“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected\\nof a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are\\nexamined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or\\nmud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a\\nquestion which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no\\nreliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer\\nbe any difficulty.”\\n\\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and\\nbowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.\\n\\n“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at his\\nenthusiasm.\\n\\n“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly\\nhave been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of\\nBradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of\\nNew Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been\\ndecisive.”\\n\\n“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a laugh. “You\\nmight start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News of the Past.’”\\n\\n“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock Holmes,\\nsticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. “I have to be\\ncareful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for I dabble with poisons\\na good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all\\nmottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\\n\\n“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged\\nstool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. “My friend here\\nwants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one\\nto go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. “I\\nhave my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would suit us down to\\nthe ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?”\\n\\n“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.\\n\\n“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do\\nexperiments. Would that annoy you?”\\n\\n“By no means.”\\n\\n“Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times,\\nand don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I\\ndo that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What have you to confess\\nnow? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before\\nthey begin to live together.”\\n\\nI laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and I object\\nto rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly\\nhours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I’m well, but\\nthose are the principal ones at present.”\\n\\n“Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked, anxiously.\\n\\n“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a treat for\\nthe gods—a badly-played one——”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may consider\\nthe thing as settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.”\\n\\n“When shall we see them?”\\n\\n“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle\\neverything,” he answered.\\n\\n“All right—noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.\\n\\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my\\nhotel.\\n\\n“By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, “how the\\ndeuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”\\n\\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little peculiarity,”\\nhe said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.”\\n\\n“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very piquant. I am\\nmuch obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper study of mankind is\\nman,’ you know.”\\n\\n“You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. “You’ll find\\nhim a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more about you than you\\nabout him. Good-bye.”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in\\nmy new acquaintance.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nWe met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\\n221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy\\nsitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So\\ndesirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem\\nwhen divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we\\nat once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from\\nthe hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with\\nseveral boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in\\nunpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\\ngradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\\nsurroundings.\\n\\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his\\nways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at\\nnight, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the\\nmorning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in\\nthe dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take\\nhim into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when\\nthe working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and\\nfor days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering\\na word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have\\nnoticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have\\nsuspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the\\ntemperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\\n\\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in\\nlife, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were\\nsuch as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was\\nrather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably\\ntaller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor\\nto which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression\\nan air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\\nsquareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably\\nblotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of\\nextraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I\\nwatched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.\\n\\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this\\nman stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the\\nreticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing\\njudgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little\\nthere was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out\\nunless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would\\ncall upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\\ncircumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my\\ncompanion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\\n\\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed\\nStamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any\\ncourse of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other\\nrecognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet\\nhis zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his\\nknowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have\\nfairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\\ninformation unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers are\\nseldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind\\nwith small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so.\\n\\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature,\\nphilosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting\\nThomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had\\ndone. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he\\nwas ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar\\nSystem. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be\\naware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an\\nextraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\\n\\n“You appear to be astonished,” he said, smiling at my expression of surprise.\\n“Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.”\\n\\n“To forget it!”\\n\\n“You see,” he explained, “I consider that a man’s brain originally is like a\\nlittle empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose.\\nA fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the\\nknowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled\\nup with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands\\nupon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes\\ninto his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in\\ndoing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most\\nperfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls\\nand can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every\\naddition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the\\nhighest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the\\nuseful ones.”\\n\\n“But the Solar System!” I protested.\\n\\n“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you say that we go\\nround the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of\\ndifference to me or to my work.”\\n\\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his\\nmanner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over\\nour short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it.\\nHe said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object.\\nTherefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to\\nhim. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown\\nme that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted\\nthem down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It\\nran in this way—\\n\\n\\nSHERLOCK HOLMES—his limits.\\n\\n\\n1. Knowledge of Literature.—Nil.\\n2. Philosophy.—Nil.\\n3. Astronomy.—Nil.\\n4. Politics.—Feeble.\\n5. Botany.—Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally.\\nKnows nothing of practical gardening.\\n6. Geology.—Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils\\nfrom each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told\\nme by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received\\nthem.\\n7. Chemistry.—Profound.\\n8. Anatomy.—Accurate, but unsystematic.\\n9. Sensational Literature.—Immense. He appears to know every detail of\\nevery horror perpetrated in the century.\\n10. Plays the violin well.\\n11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\\n12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\\n\\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair. “If I can\\nonly find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these\\naccomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,” I said to\\nmyself, “I may as well give up the attempt at once.”\\n\\nI see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These were very\\nremarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he could\\nplay pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has\\nplayed me some of Mendelssohn’s Lieder, and other favourites. When left to\\nhimself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized\\nair. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and\\nscrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the\\nchords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and\\ncheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether\\nthe music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of\\na whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against\\nthese exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by\\nplaying in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight\\ncompensation for the trial upon my patience.\\n\\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my\\ncompanion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I found\\nthat he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of\\nsociety. There was one little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was\\nintroduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single\\nweek. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half\\nan hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor,\\nlooking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was\\nclosely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a\\nrailway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript\\nindividuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of\\nthe sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me\\nfor putting me to this inconvenience. “I have to use this room as a place of\\nbusiness,” he said, “and these people are my clients.” Again I had an\\nopportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy\\nprevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time\\nthat he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled\\nthe idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord.\\n\\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose\\nsomewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet\\nfinished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits\\nthat my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable\\npetulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was\\nready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away\\nthe time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the\\narticles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye\\nthrough it.\\n\\nIts somewhat ambitious title was “The Book of Life,” and it attempted to show\\nhow much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination\\nof all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of\\nshrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the\\ndeductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed\\nby a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to\\nfathom a man’s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\\nin the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as\\ninfallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results\\nappear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had\\narrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.\\n\\n“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the\\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or\\nthe other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever\\nwe are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction\\nand Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study, nor is\\nlife long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection\\nin it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which\\npresent the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more\\nelementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he\\nbelongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of\\nobservation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man’s\\nfinger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the\\ncallosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt\\ncuffs—by each of these things a man’s calling is plainly revealed. That\\nall united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is\\nalmost inconceivable.”\\n\\n“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table, “I\\nnever read such rubbish in my life.”\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to\\nmy breakfast. “I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don’t\\ndeny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the\\ntheory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in\\nthe seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him\\nclapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give\\nthe trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against\\nhim.”\\n\\n“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. “As for the\\narticle I wrote it myself.”\\n\\n“You!”\\n\\n“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which\\nI have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really\\nextremely practical—so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and\\ncheese.”\\n\\n“And how?” I asked involuntarily.\\n\\n“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I’m\\na consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we\\nhave lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows\\nare at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They\\nlay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my\\nknowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong\\nfamily resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a\\nthousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and\\nfirst. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently\\nover a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.”\\n\\n“And these other people?”\\n\\n“They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who\\nare in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to\\ntheir story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.”\\n\\n“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room you can\\nunravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen\\nevery detail for themselves?”\\n\\n“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up\\nwhich is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with\\nmy own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the\\nproblem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction\\nlaid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in\\npractical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be\\nsurprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from\\nAfghanistan.”\\n\\n“You were told, no doubt.”\\n\\n“Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit\\nthe train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the\\nconclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such\\nsteps, however. The train of reasoning ran, ‘Here is a gentleman of a medical\\ntype, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has\\njust come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural\\ntint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and\\nsickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He\\nholds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English\\narmy doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in\\nAfghanistan.’ The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then\\nremarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.”\\n\\n“It is simple enough as you explain it,” I said, smiling. “You remind me of\\nEdgar Allen Poe’s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside\\nof stories.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. “No doubt you think that you are\\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,” he observed. “Now, in my opinion,\\nDupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his\\nfriends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour’s silence\\nis really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt;\\nbut he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.”\\n\\n“Have you read Gaboriau’s works?” I asked. “Does Lecoq come up to your idea of\\na detective?”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. “Lecoq was a miserable bungler,” he said,\\nin an angry voice; “he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his\\nenergy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an\\nunknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six\\nmonths or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to\\navoid.”\\n\\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in\\nthis cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into\\nthe busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” I said to myself, “but he is\\ncertainly very conceited.”\\n\\n“There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,” he said, querulously.\\n“What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know well that I have it\\nin me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought\\nthe same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which\\nI have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most,\\nsome bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard\\nofficial can see through it.”\\n\\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best\\nto change the topic.\\n\\n“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to a stalwart,\\nplainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the\\nstreet, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his\\nhand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.\\n\\n“You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verify his\\nguess.”\\n\\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the\\nroadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending\\nthe stair.\\n\\n“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handing my\\nfriend the letter.\\n\\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of\\nthis when he made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” I said, in the\\nblandest voice, “what your trade may be?”\\n\\n“Commissionaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”\\n\\n“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.\\n\\n“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir.”\\n\\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical\\nnature of my companion’s theories. My respect for his powers of analysis\\nincreased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind,\\nhowever, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged episode, intended to dazzle\\nme, though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my\\ncomprehension. When I looked at him he had finished reading the note, and his\\neyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental\\nabstraction.\\n\\n“How in the world did you deduce that?” I asked.\\n\\n“Deduce what?” said he, petulantly.\\n\\n“Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.”\\n\\n“I have no time for trifles,” he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,\\n“Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as\\nwell. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of\\nMarines?”\\n\\n“No, indeed.”\\n\\n“It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were asked to\\nprove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you\\nare quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue\\nanchor tattooed on the back of the fellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He\\nhad a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have\\nthe marine. He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air\\nof command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung\\nhis cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\\nhim—all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.”\\n\\n“Wonderful!” I ejaculated.\\n\\n“Commonplace,” said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was\\npleased at my evident surprise and admiration. “I said just now that there were\\nno criminals. It appears that I am wrong—look at this!” He threw me over\\nthe note which the commissionaire had brought.\\n\\n“Why,” I cried, as I cast my eye over it, “this is terrible!”\\n\\n“It does seem to be a little out of the common,” he remarked, calmly. “Would\\nyou mind reading it to me aloud?”\\n\\nThis is the letter which I read to him—\\n\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—\\n\\n“There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off\\nthe Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the\\nmorning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss.\\nHe found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture,\\ndiscovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his\\npocket bearing the name of ‘Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.’ There\\nhad been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death.\\nThere are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We\\nare at a loss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair\\nis a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you\\nwill find me there. I have left everything in statu quo until I hear\\nfrom you. If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would\\nesteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n“TOBIAS GREGSON.”\\n\\n“Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,” my friend remarked; “he and\\nLestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but\\nconventional—shockingly so. They have their knives into one another, too.\\nThey are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. There will be some fun\\nover this case if they are both put upon the scent.”\\n\\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. “Surely there is not a\\nmoment to be lost,” I cried, “shall I go and order you a cab?”\\n\\n“I’m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy devil that\\never stood in shoe leather—that is, when the fit is on me, for I can be\\nspry enough at times.”\\n\\n“Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the whole\\nmatter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the\\ncredit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.”\\n\\n“But he begs you to help him.”\\n\\n“Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but he would\\ncut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person. However, we may\\nas well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my own hook. I may have a\\nlaugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!”\\n\\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an\\nenergetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\\n\\n“Get your hat,” he said.\\n\\n“You wish me to come?”\\n\\n“Yes, if you have nothing better to do.” A minute later we were both in a\\nhansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\\n\\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. My\\ncompanion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles,\\nand the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was\\nsilent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were\\nengaged, depressed my spirits.\\n\\n“You don’t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,” I said at last,\\ninterrupting Holmes’ musical disquisition.\\n\\n“No data yet,” he answered. “It is a capital mistake to theorize before you\\nhave all the evidence. It biases the judgment.”\\n\\n“You will have your data soon,” I remarked, pointing with my finger; “this is\\nthe Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.”\\n\\n“So it is. Stop, driver, stop!” We were still a hundred yards or so from it,\\nbut he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot.\\n\\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one of\\nfour which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and\\ntwo empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows,\\nwhich were blank and dreary, save that here and there a “To Let” card had\\ndeveloped like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over\\nwith a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from\\nthe street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and\\nconsisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was\\nvery sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was\\nbounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top,\\nand against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a\\nsmall knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the\\nvain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\\n\\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house\\nand plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from\\nhis intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances,\\nseemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement,\\nand gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of\\nrailings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or\\nrather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes\\nriveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard\\nhim utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps\\nupon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over\\nit, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.\\nStill I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive\\nfaculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden\\nfrom me.\\n\\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man,\\nwith a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion’s hand\\nwith effusion. “It is indeed kind of you to come,” he said, “I have had\\neverything left untouched.”\\n\\n“Except that!” my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. “If a herd of\\nbuffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt,\\nhowever, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted\\nthis.”\\n\\n“I have had so much to do inside the house,” the detective said evasively. “My\\ncolleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this.”\\n\\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. “With two such men\\nas yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third\\nparty to find out,” he said.\\n\\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have done all\\nthat can be done,” he answered; “it’s a queer case though, and I knew your\\ntaste for such things.”\\n\\n“You did not come here in a cab?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Nor Lestrade?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Then let us go and look at the room.” With which inconsequent remark he strode\\non into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his\\nastonishment.\\n\\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two\\ndoors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously\\nbeen closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was\\nthe apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in,\\nand I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of\\ndeath inspires.\\n\\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all\\nfurniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in\\nplaces with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and\\nhung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy\\nfireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner\\nof this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so\\ndirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to\\neverything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the\\nwhole apartment.\\n\\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred\\nupon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards,\\nwith vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that\\nof a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad\\nshouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was\\ndressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured\\ntrousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim,\\nwas placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms\\nthrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death\\nstruggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression\\nof horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon\\nhuman features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\\nsimious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural\\nposture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a\\nmore fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon\\none of the main arteries of suburban London.\\n\\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and\\ngreeted my companion and myself.\\n\\n“This case will make a stir, sir,” he remarked. “It beats anything I have seen,\\nand I am no chicken.”\\n\\n“There is no clue?” said Gregson.\\n\\n“None at all,” chimed in Lestrade.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently.\\n“You are sure that there is no wound?” he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and\\nsplashes of blood which lay all round.\\n\\n“Positive!” cried both detectives.\\n\\n“Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual—presumably\\nthe murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances\\nattendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year ‘34. Do you\\nremember the case, Gregson?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Read it up—you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has\\nall been done before.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,\\nfeeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same\\nfar-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the\\nexamination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which\\nit was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man’s lips, and then glanced at\\nthe soles of his patent leather boots.\\n\\n“He has not been moved at all?” he asked.\\n\\n“No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.”\\n\\n“You can take him to the mortuary now,” he said. “There is nothing more to be\\nlearned.”\\n\\nGregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered the\\nroom, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring\\ntinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at\\nit with mystified eyes.\\n\\n“There’s been a woman here,” he cried. “It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.”\\n\\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered round\\nhim and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold\\nhad once adorned the finger of a bride.\\n\\n“This complicates matters,” said Gregson. “Heaven knows, they were complicated\\nenough before.”\\n\\n“You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?” observed Holmes. “There’s nothing to be\\nlearned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets?”\\n\\n“We have it all here,” said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one\\nof the bottom steps of the stairs. “A gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of\\nLondon. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic\\ndevice. Gold pin—bull-dog’s head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather\\ncard-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the\\nE. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven\\npounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio’s Decameron, with name of\\nJoseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf. Two letters—one addressed to E. J.\\nDrebber and one to Joseph Stangerson.”\\n\\n“At what address?”\\n\\n“American Exchange, Strand—to be left till called for. They are both from\\nthe Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from\\nLiverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New\\nYork.”\\n\\n“Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?”\\n\\n“I did it at once, sir,” said Gregson. “I have had advertisements sent to all\\nthe newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he has\\nnot returned yet.”\\n\\n“Have you sent to Cleveland?”\\n\\n“We telegraphed this morning.”\\n\\n“How did you word your inquiries?”\\n\\n“We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any\\ninformation which could help us.”\\n\\n“You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be\\ncrucial?”\\n\\n“I asked about Stangerson.”\\n\\n“Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to\\nhinge? Will you not telegraph again?”\\n\\n“I have said all I have to say,” said Gregson, in an offended voice.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some\\nremark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding\\nthis conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in\\na pompous and self-satisfied manner.\\n\\n“Mr. Gregson,” he said, “I have just made a discovery of the highest\\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful\\nexamination of the walls.”\\n\\nThe little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of\\nsuppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague.\\n\\n“Come here,” he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt\\nclearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. “Now, stand there!”\\n\\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\\n\\n“Look at that!” he said, triumphantly.\\n\\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular\\ncorner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of\\ncoarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red\\nletters a single word—\\n\\n\\nRACHE.\\n\\n“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of a showman\\nexhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner\\nof the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it\\nwith his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall!\\nThat disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to\\nwrite it on? I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at\\nthe time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the\\ndarkest portion of the wall.”\\n\\n“And what does it mean now that you have found it?” asked Gregson in a\\ndepreciatory voice.\\n\\n“Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel,\\nbut was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my words, when\\nthis case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has\\nsomething to do with it. It’s all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock\\nHolmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when\\nall is said and done.”\\n\\n“I really beg your pardon!” said my companion, who had ruffled the little man’s\\ntemper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. “You certainly have the\\ncredit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it bears\\nevery mark of having been written by the other participant in last night’s\\nmystery. I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission\\nI shall do so now.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from\\nhis pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room,\\nsometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face.\\nSo engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our\\npresence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time,\\nkeeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries\\nsuggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly\\nreminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across\\nthe lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches,\\nmeasuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were\\nentirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an\\nequally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a\\nlittle pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope.\\nFinally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every\\nletter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be\\nsatisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\\n\\n“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,” he remarked\\nwith a smile. “It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective\\nwork.”\\n\\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manœuvres of their amateur companion with\\nconsiderable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently failed to appreciate\\nthe fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes’ smallest actions\\nwere all directed towards some definite and practical end.\\n\\n“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.\\n\\n“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help\\nyou,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that it would be a pity\\nfor anyone to interfere.” There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he\\nspoke. “If you will let me know how your investigations go,” he continued, “I\\nshall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I should like to\\nspeak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and\\naddress?”\\n\\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is off duty now.\\nYou will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”\\n\\nHolmes took a note of the address.\\n\\n“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell you one\\nthing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to the two\\ndetectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was\\nmore than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his\\nheight, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came\\nhere with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with\\nthree old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the\\nmurderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were\\nremarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.”\\n\\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\\n\\n“If this man was murdered, how was it done?” asked the former.\\n\\n“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other thing,\\nLestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “‘Rache,’ is the German for\\n‘revenge;’ so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”\\n\\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals open-mouthed\\nbehind him.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIt was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led\\nme to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He\\nthen hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by\\nLestrade.\\n\\n“There is nothing like first hand evidence,” he remarked; “as a matter of fact,\\nmy mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all\\nthat is to be learned.”\\n\\n“You amaze me, Holmes,” said I. “Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to\\nbe of all those particulars which you gave.”\\n\\n“There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. “The very first thing which I\\nobserved on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels\\nclose to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so\\nthat those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during\\nthe night. There were the marks of the horse’s hoofs, too, the outline of one\\nof which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that\\nthat was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not\\nthere at any time during the morning—I have Gregson’s word for\\nthat—it follows that it must have been there during the night, and,\\ntherefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.”\\n\\n“That seems simple enough,” said I; “but how about the other man’s height?”\\n\\n“Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the\\nlength of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use\\nmy boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride both on the clay outside\\nand on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man\\nwrites on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own\\neyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child’s\\nplay.”\\n\\n“And his age?” I asked.\\n\\n“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort, he\\ncan’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the\\ngarden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone\\nround, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I\\nam simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and\\ndeduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else that\\npuzzles you?”\\n\\n“The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,” I suggested.\\n\\n“The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped in blood. My\\nglass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing\\nit, which would not have been the case if the man’s nail had been trimmed. I\\ngathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and\\nflakey—such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a\\nspecial study of cigar ashes—in fact, I have written a monograph upon the\\nsubject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any\\nknown brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the\\nskilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”\\n\\n“And the florid face?” I asked.\\n\\n“Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You\\nmust not ask me that at the present state of the affair.”\\n\\nI passed my hand over my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked; “the more\\none thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men—if\\nthere were two men—into an empty house? What has become of the cabman who\\ndrove them? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the\\nblood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part\\nin it? How came the woman’s ring there? Above all, why should the second man\\nwrite up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see\\nany possible way of reconciling all these facts.”\\n\\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\\n\\n“You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” he said.\\n“There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on\\nthe main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was simply a blind intended\\nto put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret\\nsocieties. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed\\nsomewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the\\nLatin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one,\\nbut by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert\\ninquiry into a wrong channel. I’m not going to tell you much more of the case,\\nDoctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his\\ntrick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the\\nconclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”\\n\\n“I shall never do that,” I answered; “you have brought detection as near an\\nexact science as it ever will be brought in this world.”\\n\\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which\\nI uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on\\nthe score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you one other thing,” he said. “Patent-leathers and Square-toes came\\nin the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as\\npossible—arm-in-arm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked\\nup and down the room—or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while\\nSquare-toes walked up and down. I could read all that in the dust; and I could\\nread that as he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the\\nincreased length of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working\\nhimself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I’ve told you all\\nI know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good\\nworking basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go\\nto Halle’s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.”\\n\\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through\\na long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest and\\ndreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. “That’s Audley Court in\\nthere,” he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick.\\n“You’ll find me here when you come back.”\\n\\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a\\nquadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way\\namong groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until\\nwe came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of\\nbrass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the\\nconstable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await\\nhis coming.\\n\\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his\\nslumbers. “I made my report at the office,” he said.\\n\\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. “We\\nthought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,” he said.\\n\\n“I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,” the constable answered with\\nhis eyes upon the little golden disk.\\n\\n“Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.”\\n\\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.\\n\\n“I’ll tell it ye from the beginning,” he said. “My time is from ten at night to\\nsix in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the ‘White Hart’; but bar\\nthat all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o’clock it began to rain, and I\\nmet Harry Murcher—him who has the Holland Grove beat—and we stood\\ntogether at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin’. Presently—maybe\\nabout two or a little after—I thought I would take a look round and see\\nthat all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not\\na soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a\\nstrollin’ down, thinkin’ between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot\\nwould be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of\\nthat same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was\\nempty on account of him that owns them who won’t have the drains seen to,\\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o’ typhoid fever. I\\nwas knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I\\nsuspected as something was wrong. When I got to the door——”\\n\\n“You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,” my companion\\ninterrupted. “What did you do that for?”\\n\\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost\\namazement upon his features.\\n\\n“Why, that’s true, sir,” he said; “though how you come to know it, Heaven only\\nknows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that\\nI thought I’d be none the worse for some one with me. I ain’t afeared of\\nanything on this side o’ the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him that\\ndied o’ the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me\\na kind o’ turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s\\nlantern, but there wasn’t no sign of him nor of anyone else.”\\n\\n“There was no one in the street?”\\n\\n“Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together\\nand went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so I went into\\nthe room where the light was a-burnin’. There was a candle flickerin’ on the\\nmantelpiece—a red wax one—and by its light I saw——”\\n\\n“Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times, and you\\nknelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door,\\nand then——”\\n\\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes.\\n“Where was you hid to see all that?” he cried. “It seems to me that you knows a\\ndeal more than you should.”\\n\\nHolmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable. “Don’t get\\narresting me for the murder,” he said. “I am one of the hounds and not the\\nwolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on, though. What did\\nyou do next?”\\n\\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression. “I\\nwent back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and two more\\nto the spot.”\\n\\n“Was the street empty then?”\\n\\n“Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nThe constable’s features broadened into a grin. “I’ve seen many a drunk chap in\\nmy time,” he said, “but never anyone so cryin’ drunk as that cove. He was at\\nthe gate when I came out, a-leanin’ up agin the railings, and a-singin’ at the\\npitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’s New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He\\ncouldn’t stand, far less help.”\\n\\n“What sort of a man was he?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. “He was an\\nuncommon drunk sort o’ man,” he said. “He’d ha’ found hisself in the station if\\nwe hadn’t been so took up.”\\n\\n“His face—his dress—didn’t you notice them?” Holmes broke in\\nimpatiently.\\n\\n“I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up—me\\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part\\nmuffled round——”\\n\\n“That will do,” cried Holmes. “What became of him?”\\n\\n“We’d enough to do without lookin’ after him,” the policeman said, in an\\naggrieved voice. “I’ll wager he found his way home all right.”\\n\\n“How was he dressed?”\\n\\n“A brown overcoat.”\\n\\n“Had he a whip in his hand?”\\n\\n“A whip—no.”\\n\\n“He must have left it behind,” muttered my companion. “You didn’t happen to see\\nor hear a cab after that?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“There’s a half-sovereign for you,” my companion said, standing up and taking\\nhis hat. “I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the force. That head\\nof yours should be for use as well as ornament. You might have gained your\\nsergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom you held in your hands is the man\\nwho holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use of\\narguing about it now; I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.”\\n\\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous, but\\nobviously uncomfortable.\\n\\n“The blundering fool,” Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our lodgings.\\n“Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck, and not\\ntaking advantage of it.”\\n\\n“I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this man\\ntallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why should he\\ncome back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way of criminals.”\\n\\n“The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no other\\nway of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I shall have\\nhim, Doctor—I’ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must thank you for\\nit all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have missed the finest study\\nI ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why shouldn’t we use a little art\\njargon. There’s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless\\nskein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every\\ninch of it. And now for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her\\nbowing are splendid. What’s that little thing of Chopin’s she plays so\\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”\\n\\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark\\nwhile I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nOur morning’s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired\\nout in the afternoon. After Holmes’ departure for the concert, I lay down upon\\nthe sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep. It was a useless\\nattempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the\\nstrangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my\\neyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man.\\nSo sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I\\nfound it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant\\ntype, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I\\nrecognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was\\nno condonement in the eyes of the law.\\n\\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’s hypothesis,\\nthat the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his\\nlips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to\\nthe idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man’s death, since\\nthere was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand,\\nwhose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs\\nof a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded\\nan antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep\\nwould be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident\\nmanner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the\\nfacts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.\\n\\nHe was very late in returning—so late, that I knew that the concert could\\nnot have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before he appeared.\\n\\n“It was magnificent,” he said, as he took his seat. “Do you remember what\\nDarwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and appreciating\\nit existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at.\\nPerhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories\\nin our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.”\\n\\n“That’s rather a broad idea,” I remarked.\\n\\n“One’s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,” he\\nanswered. “What’s the matter? You’re not looking quite yourself. This Brixton\\nRoad affair has upset you.”\\n\\n“To tell the truth, it has,” I said. “I ought to be more case-hardened after my\\nAfghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without\\nlosing my nerve.”\\n\\n“I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you seen\\nthe evening paper?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the fact\\nthat when the man was raised up, a woman’s wedding ring fell upon the floor. It\\nis just as well it does not.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Look at this advertisement,” he answered. “I had one sent to every paper this\\nmorning immediately after the affair.”\\n\\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It was\\nthe first announcement in the “Found” column. “In Brixton Road, this morning,”\\nit ran, “a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the ‘White\\nHart’ Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson, 221B, Baker Street, between\\neight and nine this evening.”\\n\\n“Excuse my using your name,” he said. “If I used my own some of these\\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.”\\n\\n“That is all right,” I answered. “But supposing anyone applies, I have no\\nring.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, you have,” said he, handing me one. “This will do very well. It is\\nalmost a facsimile.”\\n\\n“And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.”\\n\\n“Why, the man in the brown coat—our florid friend with the square toes.\\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.”\\n\\n“Would he not consider it as too dangerous?”\\n\\n“Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to\\nbelieve that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring.\\nAccording to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber’s body, and\\ndid not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he discovered his loss and\\nhurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own\\nfolly in leaving the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to\\nallay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the\\ngate. Now put yourself in that man’s place. On thinking the matter over, it\\nmust have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the\\nroad after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out\\nfor the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His\\neye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he\\nfear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring\\nshould be connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see\\nhim within an hour?”\\n\\n“And then?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?”\\n\\n“I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.”\\n\\n“You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and though I\\nshall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything.”\\n\\nI went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the pistol\\nthe table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation\\nof scraping upon his violin.\\n\\n“The plot thickens,” he said, as I entered; “I have just had an answer to my\\nAmerican telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.”\\n\\n“And that is?” I asked eagerly.\\n\\n“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your pistol\\nin your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way. Leave\\nthe rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at him too hard.”\\n\\n“It is eight o’clock now,” I said, glancing at my watch.\\n\\n“Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly. That\\nwill do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a queer old book I\\npicked up at a stall yesterday—‘De Jure inter Gentes’—published in\\nLatin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles’ head was still firm on his\\nshoulders when this little brown-backed volume was struck off.”\\n\\n“Who is the printer?”\\n\\n“Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very faded\\nink, is written ‘Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.’ I wonder who William Whyte was.\\nSome pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a legal\\ntwist about it. Here comes our man, I think.”\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose softly and\\nmoved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the servant pass along\\nthe hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it.\\n\\n“Does Dr. Watson live here?” asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We could not\\nhear the servant’s reply, but the door closed, and some one began to ascend the\\nstairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise\\npassed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along\\nthe passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door.\\n\\n“Come in,” I cried.\\n\\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and\\nwrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be dazzled by the\\nsudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us\\nwith her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers. I\\nglanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate\\nexpression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance.\\n\\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement.\\n“It’s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,” she said, dropping another\\ncurtsey; “a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It belongs to my girl Sally,\\nas was married only this time twelvemonth, which her husband is steward aboard\\na Union boat, and what he’d say if he come ‘ome and found her without her ring\\nis more than I can think, he being short enough at the best o’ times, but more\\nespecially when he has the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last\\nnight along with——”\\n\\n“Is that her ring?” I asked.\\n\\n“The Lord be thanked!” cried the old woman; “Sally will be a glad woman this\\nnight. That’s the ring.”\\n\\n“And what may your address be?” I inquired, taking up a pencil.\\n\\n“13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.”\\n\\n“The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,” said\\nSherlock Holmes sharply.\\n\\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed\\neyes. “The gentleman asked me for my address,” she said. “Sally lives in\\nlodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.”\\n\\n“And your name is——?”\\n\\n“My name is Sawyer—her’s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married\\nher—and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he’s at sea, and no steward\\nin the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what\\nwith liquor shops——”\\n\\n“Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,” I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my\\ncompanion; “it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to\\nrestore it to the rightful owner.”\\n\\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed\\nit away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock Holmes sprang\\nto his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. He returned\\nin a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. “I’ll follow her,” he\\nsaid, hurriedly; “she must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up\\nfor me.” The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had\\ndescended the stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly\\nalong the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.\\n“Either his whole theory is incorrect,” I thought to myself, “or else he will\\nbe led now to the heart of the mystery.” There was no need for him to ask me to\\nwait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until I heard the result\\nof his adventure.\\n\\nIt was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might be, but\\nI sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger’s\\n“Vie de Bohème.” Ten o’clock passed, and I heard the footsteps of the maid as\\nthey pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady\\npassed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon twelve before\\nI heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his\\nface that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be\\nstruggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he\\nburst into a hearty laugh.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,” he cried,\\ndropping into his chair; “I have chaffed them so much that they would never\\nhave let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I know that I\\nwill be even with them in the long run.”\\n\\n“What is it then?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had gone a\\nlittle way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore.\\nPresently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. I\\nmanaged to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been\\nso anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of\\nthe street, ‘Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,’ she cried. This begins\\nto look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself\\nbehind. That’s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away\\nwe rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question. I\\nhopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy,\\nlounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open\\nthe door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he\\nwas groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest\\nassorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or\\ntrace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his\\nfare. On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a\\nrespectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of\\nSawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean to say,” I cried, in amazement, “that that tottering, feeble\\nold woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either\\nyou or the driver seeing her?”\\n\\n“Old woman be damned!” said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. “We were the old women to\\nbe so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides\\nbeing an incomparable actor. The get-up was inimitable. He saw that he was\\nfollowed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip. It shows that\\nthe man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who\\nare ready to risk something for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take\\nmy advice and turn in.”\\n\\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left Holmes\\nseated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night\\nI heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew that he was still\\npondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe papers next day were full of the “Brixton Mystery,” as they termed it. Each\\nhad a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in addition.\\nThere was some information in them which was new to me. I still retain in my\\nscrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case. Here is a\\ncondensation of a few of them:—\\n\\nThe Daily Telegraph remarked that in the history of crime there had\\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the\\nvictim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the\\nwall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists.\\nThe Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt,\\ninfringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding\\nairily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de\\nBrinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff\\nHighway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and\\nadvocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.\\n\\nThe Standard commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort\\nusually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling\\nof the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. The\\ndeceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the\\nMetropolis. He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in\\nTorquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private\\nsecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon\\nTuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed\\nintention of catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together\\nupon the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber’s body was,\\nas recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from\\nEuston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are\\nstill involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson.\\nWe are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are\\nboth engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these\\nwell-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter.\\n\\nThe Daily News observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a\\npolitical one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the\\nContinental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of\\nmen who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the\\nrecollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a\\nstringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death.\\nEvery effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain\\nsome particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been gained by\\nthe discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded—a\\nresult which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of\\nScotland Yard.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they\\nappeared to afford him considerable amusement.\\n\\n“I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to\\nscore.”\\n\\n“That depends on how it turns out.”\\n\\n“Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it will\\nbe on account of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be in\\nspite of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever\\nthey do, they will have followers. ‘Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui\\nl’admire.’”\\n\\n“What on earth is this?” I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering\\nof many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible expressions\\nof disgust upon the part of our landlady.\\n\\n“It’s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,” said my\\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of\\nthe dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on.\\n\\n“‘Tention!” cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little scoundrels\\nstood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. “In future you shall send\\nup Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street. Have\\nyou found it, Wiggins?”\\n\\n“No, sir, we hain’t,” said one of the youths.\\n\\n“I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are your\\nwages.” He handed each of them a shilling.\\n\\n“Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.”\\n\\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and we\\nheard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\\n\\n“There’s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a\\ndozen of the force,” Holmes remarked. “The mere sight of an official-looking\\nperson seals men’s lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear\\neverything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation.”\\n\\n“Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?” I asked.\\n\\n“Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter of\\ntime. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! Here is\\nGregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his\\nface. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!”\\n\\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired\\ndetective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our\\nsitting-room.\\n\\n“My dear fellow,” he cried, wringing Holmes’ unresponsive hand, “congratulate\\nme! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.”\\n\\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion’s expressive face.\\n\\n“Do you mean that you are on the right track?” he asked.\\n\\n“The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.”\\n\\n“And his name is?”\\n\\n“Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy,” cried Gregson,\\npompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\\n\\n“Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,” he said. “We are anxious to know\\nhow you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?”\\n\\n“I don’t mind if I do,” the detective answered. “The tremendous exertions which\\nI have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much\\nbodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will\\nappreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers.”\\n\\n“You do me too much honour,” said Holmes, gravely. “Let us hear how you arrived\\nat this most gratifying result.”\\n\\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his\\ncigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement.\\n\\n“The fun of it is,” he cried, “that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so\\nsmart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary\\nStangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have\\nno doubt that he has caught him by this time.”\\n\\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\\n\\n“And how did you get your clue?”\\n\\n“Ah, I’ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly\\nbetween ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the\\nfinding of this American’s antecedents. Some people would have waited until\\ntheir advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and\\nvolunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson’s way of going to work. You\\nremember the hat beside the dead man?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Holmes; “by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.”\\n\\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\\n\\n“I had no idea that you noticed that,” he said. “Have you been there?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Ha!” cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; “you should never neglect a chance,\\nhowever small it may seem.”\\n\\n“To a great mind, nothing is little,” remarked Holmes, sententiously.\\n\\n“Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and\\ndescription. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the\\nhat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier’s Boarding Establishment, Torquay\\nTerrace. Thus I got at his address.”\\n\\n“Smart—very smart!” murmured Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“I next called upon Madame Charpentier,” continued the detective. “I found her\\nvery pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room, too—an uncommonly\\nfine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled\\nas I spoke to her. That didn’t escape my notice. I began to smell a rat. You\\nknow the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right\\nscent—a kind of thrill in your nerves. ‘Have you heard of the mysterious\\ndeath of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?’ I asked.\\n\\n“The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst\\ninto tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the\\nmatter.\\n\\n“‘At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘At eight o’clock,’ she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\\nagitation. ‘His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\\ntrains—one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.’\\n\\n“‘And was that the last which you saw of him?’\\n\\n“A terrible change came over the woman’s face as I asked the question. Her\\nfeatures turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she could get out\\nthe single word ‘Yes’—and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural\\ntone.\\n\\n“There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear\\nvoice.\\n\\n“‘No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,’ she said. ‘Let us be frank with\\nthis gentleman. We did see Mr. Drebber again.’\\n\\n“‘God forgive you!’ cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and sinking\\nback in her chair. ‘You have murdered your brother.’\\n\\n“‘Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,’ the girl answered firmly.\\n\\n“‘You had best tell me all about it now,’ I said. ‘Half-confidences are worse\\nthan none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.’\\n\\n“‘On your head be it, Alice!’ cried her mother; and then, turning to me, ‘I\\nwill tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son\\narises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He\\nis utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the\\neyes of others he may appear to be compromised. That however is surely\\nimpossible. His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all\\nforbid it.’\\n\\n“‘Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,’ I answered. ‘Depend\\nupon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.’\\n\\n“‘Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,’ she said, and her daughter\\nwithdrew. ‘Now, sir,’ she continued, ‘I had no intention of telling you all\\nthis, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative. Having\\nonce decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular.’\\n\\n“‘It is your wisest course,’ said I.\\n\\n“‘Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary, Mr.\\nStangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a “Copenhagen”\\nlabel upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping\\nplace. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to\\nsay, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways.\\nThe very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and,\\nindeed, after twelve o’clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be\\nsober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and\\nfamiliar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my\\ndaughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately,\\nshe is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in\\nhis arms and embraced her—an outrage which caused his own secretary to\\nreproach him for his unmanly conduct.’\\n\\n“‘But why did you stand all this,’ I asked. ‘I suppose that you can get rid of\\nyour boarders when you wish.’\\n\\n“Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. ‘Would to God that I had\\ngiven him notice on the very day that he came,’ she said. ‘But it was a sore\\ntemptation. They were paying a pound a day each—fourteen pounds a week,\\nand this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me\\nmuch. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too\\nmuch, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the\\nreason of his going.’\\n\\n“‘Well?’\\n\\n“‘My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave just now,\\nbut I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he\\nis passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the door behind them a load\\nseemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring\\nat the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited,\\nand evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was\\nsitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed\\nhis train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her\\nthat she should fly with him. “You are of age,” he said, “and there is no law\\nto stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here,\\nbut come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess.” Poor\\nAlice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the\\nwrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that\\nmoment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I\\nheard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise\\nmy head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with\\na stick in his hand. “I don’t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,” he\\nsaid. “I will just go after him and see what he does with himself.” With those\\nwords he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we\\nheard of Mr. Drebber’s mysterious death.’\\n\\n“This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier’s lips with many gasps and pauses.\\nAt times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand\\nnotes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of\\na mistake.”\\n\\n“It’s quite exciting,” said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. “What happened next?”\\n\\n“When Mrs. Charpentier paused,” the detective continued, “I saw that the whole\\ncase hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found\\neffective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.\\n\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered.\\n\\n“‘Not know?’\\n\\n“‘No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.’\\n\\n“‘After you went to bed?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘When did you go to bed?’\\n\\n“‘About eleven.’\\n\\n“‘So your son was gone at least two hours?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘Possibly four or five?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘What was he doing during that time?’\\n\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered, turning white to her very lips.\\n\\n“Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where\\nLieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. When I\\ntouched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered\\nus as bold as brass, ‘I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the\\ndeath of that scoundrel Drebber,’ he said. We had said nothing to him about it,\\nso that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.”\\n\\n“Very,” said Holmes.\\n\\n“He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with\\nhim when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.”\\n\\n“What is your theory, then?”\\n\\n“Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When\\nthere, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber\\nreceived a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which\\nkilled him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was\\nabout, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As\\nto the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they\\nmay all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.”\\n\\n“Well done!” said Holmes in an encouraging voice. “Really, Gregson, you are\\ngetting along. We shall make something of you yet.”\\n\\n“I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,” the detective answered\\nproudly. “The young man volunteered a statement, in which he said that after\\nfollowing Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order\\nto get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long\\nwalk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to\\ngive any satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits together uncommonly\\nwell. What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the\\nwrong scent. I am afraid he won’t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here’s the\\nvery man himself!”\\n\\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and\\nwho now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked\\nhis demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His face was disturbed and\\ntroubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come\\nwith the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his\\ncolleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of\\nthe room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. “This is a\\nmost extraordinary case,” he said at last—“a most incomprehensible\\naffair.”\\n\\n“Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!” cried Gregson, triumphantly. “I thought you\\nwould come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the Secretary, Mr.\\nJoseph Stangerson?”\\n\\n“The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,” said Lestrade gravely, “was murdered at\\nHalliday’s Private Hotel about six o’clock this morning.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang out of\\nhis chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I stared in silence\\nat Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over\\nhis eyes.\\n\\n“Stangerson too!” he muttered. “The plot thickens.”\\n\\n“It was quite thick enough before,” grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair. “I seem\\nto have dropped into a sort of council of war.”\\n\\n“Are you—are you sure of this piece of intelligence?” stammered Gregson.\\n\\n“I have just come from his room,” said Lestrade. “I was the first to discover\\nwhat had occurred.”\\n\\n“We have been hearing Gregson’s view of the matter,” Holmes observed. “Would\\nyou mind letting us know what you have seen and done?”\\n\\n“I have no objection,” Lestrade answered, seating himself. “I freely confess\\nthat I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of\\nDrebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken.\\nFull of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the\\nSecretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight\\non the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in\\nthe Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how\\nStangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what\\nhad become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description\\nof the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then\\nset to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of\\nEuston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become\\nseparated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in\\nthe vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next\\nmorning.”\\n\\n“They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,” remarked\\nHolmes.\\n\\n“So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries\\nentirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight o’clock I\\nreached Halliday’s Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to\\nwhether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the\\naffirmative.\\n\\n“‘No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,’ they said. ‘He has\\nbeen waiting for a gentleman for two days.’\\n\\n“‘Where is he now?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.’\\n\\n“‘I will go up and see him at once,’ I said.\\n\\n“It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him\\nto say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was\\non the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The Boots\\npointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw\\nsomething that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years’ experience.\\nFrom under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had\\nmeandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the\\nother side. I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when\\nhe saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it,\\nand knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all\\nhuddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had\\nbeen for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over,\\nthe Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged\\nthe room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep\\nstab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the\\nstrangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?”\\n\\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even\\nbefore Sherlock Holmes answered.\\n\\n“The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,” he said.\\n\\n“That was it,” said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent\\nfor a while.\\n\\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of\\nthis unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My\\nnerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of\\nit.\\n\\n“The man was seen,” continued Lestrade. “A milk boy, passing on his way to the\\ndairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of\\nthe hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised\\nagainst one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After\\npassing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so\\nquietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at\\nwork in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his\\nown mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that the\\nman was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He\\nmust have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found\\nblood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on\\nthe sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.”\\n\\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied\\nso exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or\\nsatisfaction upon his face.\\n\\n“Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?”\\nhe asked.\\n\\n“Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber’s purse in his pocket, but it seems that this\\nwas usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but\\nnothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes,\\nrobbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the\\nmurdered man’s pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a\\nmonth ago, and containing the words, ‘J. H. is in Europe.’ There was no name\\nappended to this message.”\\n\\n“And there was nothing else?” Holmes asked.\\n\\n“Nothing of any importance. The man’s novel, with which he had read himself to\\nsleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. There was\\na glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box\\ncontaining a couple of pills.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\\n\\n“The last link,” he cried, exultantly. “My case is complete.”\\n\\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement.\\n\\n“I have now in my hands,” my companion said, confidently, “all the threads\\nwhich have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be filled in,\\nbut I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted\\nfrom Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter,\\nas if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my\\nknowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?”\\n\\n“I have them,” said Lestrade, producing a small white box; “I took them and the\\npurse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the\\nPolice Station. It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am bound\\nto say that I do not attach any importance to them.”\\n\\n“Give them here,” said Holmes. “Now, Doctor,” turning to me, “are those\\nordinary pills?”\\n\\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and\\nalmost transparent against the light. “From their lightness and transparency, I\\nshould imagine that they are soluble in water,” I remarked.\\n\\n“Precisely so,” answered Holmes. “Now would you mind going down and fetching\\nthat poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the\\nlandlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.”\\n\\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. Its laboured\\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its\\nsnow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of\\ncanine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug.\\n\\n“I will now cut one of these pills in two,” said Holmes, and drawing his\\npenknife he suited the action to the word. “One half we return into the box for\\nfuture purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass, in which is a\\nteaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right, and\\nthat it readily dissolves.”\\n\\n“This may be very interesting,” said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who\\nsuspects that he is being laughed at, “I cannot see, however, what it has to do\\nwith the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.”\\n\\n“Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has everything to\\ndo with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on\\npresenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough.”\\n\\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed\\nit in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock Holmes’\\nearnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching\\nthe animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. None such appeared,\\nhowever. The dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a\\nlaboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.\\n\\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result,\\nan expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his\\nfeatures. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed\\nevery other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I felt\\nsincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no\\nmeans displeased at this check which he had met.\\n\\n“It can’t be a coincidence,” he cried, at last springing from his chair and\\npacing wildly up and down the room; “it is impossible that it should be a mere\\ncoincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are\\nactually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert. What can\\nit mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is\\nimpossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have\\nit!” With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill\\nin two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\\nunfortunate creature’s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before\\nit gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if\\nit had been struck by lightning.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\\nforehead. “I should have more faith,” he said; “I ought to know by this time\\nthat when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it\\ninvariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. Of the\\ntwo pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was\\nentirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at\\nall.”\\n\\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly\\nbelieve that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however, to\\nprove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in\\nmy own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague\\nperception of the truth.\\n\\n“All this seems strange to you,” continued Holmes, “because you failed at the\\nbeginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which\\nwas presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything\\nwhich has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition,\\nand, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed\\nyou and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to\\nstrengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with\\nmystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it\\npresents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This\\nmurder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the\\nvictim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outré\\nand sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange\\ndetails, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of\\nmaking it less so.”\\n\\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience,\\ncould contain himself no longer. “Look here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, “we\\nare all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your\\nown methods of working. We want something more than mere theory and preaching\\nnow, though. It is a case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it\\nseems I was wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second\\naffair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was\\nwrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know\\nmore than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask\\nyou straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the man who did\\nit?”\\n\\n“I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,” remarked Lestrade. “We have\\nboth tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once since I\\nhave been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require. Surely\\nyou will not withhold it any longer.”\\n\\n“Any delay in arresting the assassin,” I observed, “might give him time to\\nperpetrate some fresh atrocity.”\\n\\nThus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to\\nwalk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn\\ndown, as was his habit when lost in thought.\\n\\n“There will be no more murders,” he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing\\nus. “You can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I\\nknow the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small\\nthing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I\\nexpect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own\\narrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a\\nshrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion\\nto prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no\\nidea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if\\nhe had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an\\ninstant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning\\nto hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to\\nbe more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked\\nyour assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this\\nomission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the\\ninstant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own\\ncombinations, I shall do so.”\\n\\nGregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by\\nthe depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had flushed up to\\nthe roots of his flaxen hair, while the other’s beady eyes glistened with\\ncuriosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to speak, however, before\\nthere was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young\\nWiggins, introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.\\n\\n“Please, sir,” he said, touching his forelock, “I have the cab downstairs.”\\n\\n“Good boy,” said Holmes, blandly. “Why don’t you introduce this pattern at\\nScotland Yard?” he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer.\\n“See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an instant.”\\n\\n“The old pattern is good enough,” remarked Lestrade, “if we can only find the\\nman to put them on.”\\n\\n“Very good, very good,” said Holmes, smiling. “The cabman may as well help me\\nwith my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.”\\n\\nI was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set\\nout on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it. There was a\\nsmall portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and began to strap. He\\nwas busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room.\\n\\n“Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,” he said, kneeling over his\\ntask, and never turning his head.\\n\\nThe fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put down his\\nhands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling of\\nmetal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” he cried, with flashing eyes, “let me introduce you to Mr.\\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.”\\n\\nThe whole thing occurred in a moment—so quickly that I had no time to\\nrealize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes’ triumphant\\nexpression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman’s dazed, savage face, as he\\nglared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his\\nwrists. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with\\nan inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes’s\\ngrasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way\\nbefore him; but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes\\nsprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and\\nthen commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that the\\nfour of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive\\nstrength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled\\nby his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in\\ndiminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his\\nhand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that\\nhis struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had\\npinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet\\nbreathless and panting.\\n\\n“We have his cab,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It will serve to take him to Scotland\\nYard. And now, gentlemen,” he continued, with a pleasant smile, “we have\\nreached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to put any\\nquestions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse to\\nanswer them.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIn the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid\\nand repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against\\nthe advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the\\nYellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of\\ndesolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim\\ndistrict. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy\\nvalleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and\\nthere are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer\\nare grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common\\ncharacteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\\n\\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of\\nBlackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds,\\nbut the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains,\\nand to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The coyote skulks among\\nthe scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly\\nbear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can\\namongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\\n\\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern\\nslope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the great\\nflat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by\\nclumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge of the horizon\\nlie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with\\nsnow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of\\nanything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no\\nmovement upon the dull, grey earth—above all, there is absolute silence.\\nListen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness;\\nnothing but silence—complete and heart-subduing silence.\\n\\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain.\\nThat is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway\\ntraced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme\\ndistance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many\\nadventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in\\nthe sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and\\nexamine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more\\ndelicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen\\nhundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered\\nremains of those who had fallen by the wayside.\\n\\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen\\nhundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he\\nmight have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have\\nfound it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face\\nwas lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over\\nthe projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and\\ndashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an\\nunnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy\\nthan that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support,\\nand yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry\\nand vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung\\nso baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that\\nsenile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying—dying from hunger and\\nfrom thirst.\\n\\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in\\nthe vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched\\nbefore his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign\\nanywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In\\nall that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west\\nhe looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings\\nhad come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die.\\n“Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,” he muttered,\\nas he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\\n\\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and\\nalso a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried slung over\\nhis right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for\\nin lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. Instantly\\nthere broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there\\nprotruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little\\nspeckled, dimpled fists.\\n\\n“You’ve hurt me!” said a childish voice reproachfully.\\n\\n“Have I though,” the man answered penitently, “I didn’t go for to do it.” As he\\nspoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about\\nfive years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little\\nlinen apron all bespoke a mother’s care. The child was pale and wan, but her\\nhealthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.\\n\\n“How is it now?” he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the towsy\\ngolden curls which covered the back of her head.\\n\\n“Kiss it and make it well,” she said, with perfect gravity, showing the injured\\npart up to him. “That’s what mother used to do. Where’s mother?”\\n\\n“Mother’s gone. I guess you’ll see her before long.”\\n\\n“Gone, eh!” said the little girl. “Funny, she didn’t say good-bye; she ‘most\\nalways did if she was just goin’ over to Auntie’s for tea, and now she’s been\\naway three days. Say, it’s awful dry, ain’t it? Ain’t there no water, nor\\nnothing to eat?”\\n\\n“No, there ain’t nothing, dearie. You’ll just need to be patient awhile, and\\nthen you’ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and then you’ll\\nfeel bullier. It ain’t easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess\\nI’d best let you know how the cards lie. What’s that you’ve got?”\\n\\n“Pretty things! fine things!” cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding\\nup two glittering fragments of mica. “When we goes back to home I’ll give them\\nto brother Bob.”\\n\\n“You’ll see prettier things than them soon,” said the man confidently. “You\\njust wait a bit. I was going to tell you though—you remember when we left\\nthe river?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes.”\\n\\n“Well, we reckoned we’d strike another river soon, d’ye see. But there was\\nsomethin’ wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin’, and it didn’t turn up. Water\\nran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you\\nand—and——”\\n\\n“And you couldn’t wash yourself,” interrupted his companion gravely, staring up\\nat his grimy visage.\\n\\n“No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete,\\nand then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother.”\\n\\n“Then mother’s a deader too,” cried the little girl dropping her face in her\\npinafore and sobbing bitterly.\\n\\n“Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some chance of\\nwater in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it\\ntogether. It don’t seem as though we’ve improved matters. There’s an almighty\\nsmall chance for us now!”\\n\\n“Do you mean that we are going to die too?” asked the child, checking her sobs,\\nand raising her tear-stained face.\\n\\n“I guess that’s about the size of it.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you say so before?” she said, laughing gleefully. “You gave me such\\na fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we’ll be with mother again.”\\n\\n“Yes, you will, dearie.”\\n\\n“And you too. I’ll tell her how awful good you’ve been. I’ll bet she meets us\\nat the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat\\ncakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of. How long\\nwill it be first?”\\n\\n“I don’t know—not very long.” The man’s eyes were fixed upon the northern\\nhorizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks\\nwhich increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They\\nspeedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over\\nthe heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which\\noverlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is\\nthe forerunner of death.\\n\\n“Cocks and hens,” cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened\\nforms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. “Say, did God make this\\ncountry?”\\n\\n“In course He did,” said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected\\nquestion.\\n\\n“He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,” the little\\ngirl continued. “I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It’s\\nnot nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees.”\\n\\n“What would ye think of offering up prayer?” the man asked diffidently.\\n\\n“It ain’t night yet,” she answered.\\n\\n“It don’t matter. It ain’t quite regular, but He won’t mind that, you bet. You\\nsay over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was\\non the Plains.”\\n\\n“Why don’t you say some yourself?” the child asked, with wondering eyes.\\n\\n“I disremember them,” he answered. “I hain’t said none since I was half the\\nheight o’ that gun. I guess it’s never too late. You say them out, and I’ll\\nstand by and come in on the choruses.”\\n\\n“Then you’ll need to kneel down, and me too,” she said, laying the shawl out\\nfor that purpose. “You’ve got to put your hands up like this. It makes you feel\\nkind o’ good.”\\n\\nIt was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it. Side\\nby side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child\\nand the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face, and his haggard,\\nangular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt\\nentreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face, while the two\\nvoices—the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh—united in\\nthe entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their\\nseat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon\\nthe broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time,\\nbut Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he\\nhad allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over\\nthe tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the\\nman’s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both\\nslept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\\n\\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would\\nhave met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose\\nup a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished\\nfrom the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until\\nit formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size\\nuntil it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of\\nmoving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the\\nconclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie\\nland was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As\\nthe whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two\\ncastaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of\\narmed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed\\nitself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a\\ncaravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear\\nwas not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched\\nthe straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot.\\nInnumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled\\nbeside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was\\nevidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had\\nbeen compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country.\\nThere rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this\\ngreat mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses.\\nLoud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above\\nthem.\\n\\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men,\\nclad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of\\nthe bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves.\\n\\n“The wells are to the right, my brothers,” said one, a hard-lipped,\\nclean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\\n\\n“To the right of the Sierra Blanco—so we shall reach the Rio Grande,”\\nsaid another.\\n\\n“Fear not for water,” cried a third. “He who could draw it from the rocks will\\nnot now abandon His own chosen people.”\\n\\n“Amen! Amen!” responded the whole party.\\n\\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above\\nthem. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard\\nand bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a general\\nreining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came\\ngalloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word ‘Redskins’ was on every lip.\\n\\n“There can’t be any number of Injuns here,” said the elderly man who appeared\\nto be in command. “We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes\\nuntil we cross the great mountains.”\\n\\n“Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,” asked one of the band.\\n\\n“And I,” “and I,” cried a dozen voices.\\n\\n“Leave your horses below and we will await you here,” the Elder answered. In a\\nmoment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were\\nascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited\\ntheir curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and\\ndexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see them\\nflit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline. The\\nyoung man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his\\nfollowers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and\\non joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their\\neyes.\\n\\nOn the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant\\nboulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and\\nhard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular\\nbreathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little child, with\\nher round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired\\nhead resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted,\\nshowing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played\\nover her infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white\\nsocks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the\\nlong shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this\\nstrange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new\\ncomers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.\\n\\nThe cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about them in\\nbewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain\\nwhich had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now\\ntraversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an\\nexpression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his\\neyes. “This is what they call delirium, I guess,” he muttered. The child stood\\nbeside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked\\nall round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood.\\n\\nThe rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their\\nappearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted her\\nupon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and assisted\\nhim towards the waggons.\\n\\n“My name is John Ferrier,” the wanderer explained; “me and that little un are\\nall that’s left o’ twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o’ thirst and hunger\\naway down in the south.”\\n\\n“Is she your child?” asked someone.\\n\\n“I guess she is now,” the other cried, defiantly; “she’s mine ‘cause I saved\\nher. No man will take her from me. She’s Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who are\\nyou, though?” he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart, sunburned\\nrescuers; “there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.”\\n\\n“Nigh upon ten thousand,” said one of the young men; “we are the persecuted\\nchildren of God—the chosen of the Angel Merona.”\\n\\n“I never heard tell on him,” said the wanderer. “He appears to have chosen a\\nfair crowd of ye.”\\n\\n“Do not jest at that which is sacred,” said the other sternly. “We are of those\\nwho believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of\\nbeaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra. We have\\ncome from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had founded our temple. We\\nhave come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even\\nthough it be the heart of the desert.”\\n\\nThe name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. “I see,”\\nhe said, “you are the Mormons.”\\n\\n“We are the Mormons,” answered his companions with one voice.\\n\\n“And where are you going?”\\n\\n“We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet.\\nYou must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with you.”\\n\\nThey had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by\\ncrowds of the pilgrims—pale-faced meek-looking women, strong laughing\\nchildren, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of astonishment and\\nof commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of\\nthe strangers and the destitution of the other. Their escort did not halt,\\nhowever, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they\\nreached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the\\ngaudiness and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas\\nthe others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the\\ndriver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age,\\nbut whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He was\\nreading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside,\\nand listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned to the\\ntwo castaways.\\n\\n“If we take you with us,” he said, in solemn words, “it can only be as\\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far\\nthat your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to\\nbe that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you\\ncome with us on these terms?”\\n\\n“Guess I’ll come with you on any terms,” said Ferrier, with such emphasis that\\nthe grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone retained his\\nstern, impressive expression.\\n\\n“Take him, Brother Stangerson,” he said, “give him food and drink, and the\\nchild likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have\\ndelayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!”\\n\\n“On, on to Zion!” cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the\\nlong caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur\\nin the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the\\ngreat waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along\\nonce more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led them\\nto his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them.\\n\\n“You shall remain here,” he said. “In a few days you will have recovered from\\nyour fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our\\nreligion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph\\nSmith, which is the voice of God.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThis is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the\\nimmigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the shores of the\\nMississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on\\nwith a constancy almost unparalleled in history. The savage man, and the savage\\nbeast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease—every impediment which Nature\\ncould place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet\\nthe long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the\\nstoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in\\nheartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight\\nbeneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the\\npromised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore.\\n\\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a\\nresolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city\\nwas sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion\\nto the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the\\nartisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by\\nmagic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing,\\nuntil the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop.\\nEverything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple\\nwhich they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.\\nFrom the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of\\nthe hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the\\nimmigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.\\n\\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes\\nand had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of\\ntheir great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough\\nin Elder Stangerson’s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon’s\\nthree wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having\\nrallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her\\nmother’s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to\\nthis new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having\\nrecovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an\\nindefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions,\\nthat when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed\\nthat he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any\\nof the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson,\\nKemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.\\n\\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house,\\nwhich received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy\\nvilla. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and\\nskilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and\\nevening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm\\nand all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was\\nbetter off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich,\\nand in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City\\nwho could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch\\nMountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.\\n\\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his\\nco-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a\\nfemale establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons\\nfor this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly\\nadhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness\\nin his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and\\nreluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair,\\nand of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic.\\nWhatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect\\nhe conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of\\nbeing an orthodox and straight-walking man.\\n\\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in\\nall his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of\\nthe pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year\\nsucceeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her\\nstep more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier’s\\nfarm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her\\nlithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon\\nher father’s mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true\\nchild of the West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw\\nher father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American\\ngirlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\\n\\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change is\\ntoo subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the\\nmaiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets\\nher heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of\\nfear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who\\ncannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the\\ndawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough\\nin itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many\\nbesides.\\n\\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees\\nwhose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in the streets\\nrose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long\\nstreams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had\\nbroken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the\\nElect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the\\noutlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally\\nweary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage,\\nthreading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy\\nFerrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair\\nfloating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and\\nwas dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of\\nyouth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The\\ntravel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the\\nunemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed\\nstoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.\\n\\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a\\ngreat drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the\\nplains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her\\nhorse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it,\\nhowever, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself\\ncompletely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks.\\nAccustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her\\nsituation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the\\nhopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one\\nof the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with\\nthe flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up\\nupon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that\\nwould have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of\\nperil. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again,\\nand goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep\\nherself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs\\nof the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her\\nhead began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising\\ncloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have\\nabandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which\\nassured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the\\nfrightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought\\nher to the outskirts.\\n\\n“You’re not hurt, I hope, miss,” said her preserver, respectfully.\\n\\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. “I’m awful\\nfrightened,” she said, naively; “whoever would have thought that Poncho would\\nhave been so scared by a lot of cows?”\\n\\n“Thank God you kept your seat,” the other said earnestly. He was a tall,\\nsavage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the\\nrough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders. “I guess\\nyou are the daughter of John Ferrier,” he remarked, “I saw you ride down from\\nhis house. When you see him, ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St.\\nLouis. If he’s the same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.”\\n\\n“Hadn’t you better come and ask yourself?” she asked, demurely.\\n\\nThe young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled\\nwith pleasure. “I’ll do so,” he said, “we’ve been in the mountains for two\\nmonths, and are not over and above in visiting condition. He must take us as he\\nfinds us.”\\n\\n“He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,” she answered, “he’s awful\\nfond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he’d have never got over it.”\\n\\n“Neither would I,” said her companion.\\n\\n“You! Well, I don’t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You\\nain’t even a friend of ours.”\\n\\nThe young hunter’s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier\\nlaughed aloud.\\n\\n“There, I didn’t mean that,” she said; “of course, you are a friend now. You\\nmust come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won’t trust me with his\\nbusiness any more. Good-bye!”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her\\nlittle hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her riding-whip,\\nand darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust.\\n\\nYoung Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and\\nthey had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were\\nreturning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some\\nlodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the\\nbusiness until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another\\nchannel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra\\nbreezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she\\nhad vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life,\\nand that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of\\nsuch importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had\\nsprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but\\nrather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper.\\nHe had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his\\nheart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance\\ncould render him successful.\\n\\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was\\na familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed\\nin his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world\\nduring the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and\\nin a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer\\nin California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and\\nfortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a\\ntrapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were\\nto be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a\\nfavourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such\\noccasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes,\\nshowed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest\\nfather may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown\\naway upon the man who had won her affections.\\n\\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at\\nthe gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw the\\nbridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\\n\\n“I am off, Lucy,” he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly\\ndown into her face; “I won’t ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready\\nto come when I am here again?”\\n\\n“And when will that be?” she asked, blushing and laughing.\\n\\n“A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my darling.\\nThere’s no one who can stand between us.”\\n\\n“And how about father?” she asked.\\n\\n“He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all right. I\\nhave no fear on that head.”\\n\\n“Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there’s no more\\nto be said,” she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast.\\n\\n“Thank God!” he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. “It is settled, then.\\nThe longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me at the\\ncañon. Good-bye, my own darling—good-bye. In two months you shall see\\nme.”\\n\\nHe tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse,\\ngalloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his\\nresolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving. She\\nstood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she\\nwalked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThree weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed from\\nSalt Lake City. John Ferrier’s heart was sore within him when he thought of the\\nyoung man’s return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her\\nbright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument\\ncould have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart,\\nthat nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such\\na marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace.\\nWhatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an\\nunorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the\\nSaints.\\n\\nYes, a dangerous matter—so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which\\nfell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution\\nupon them. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own\\naccount, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition\\nof Seville, nor the German Vehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy,\\nwere ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which\\ncast a cloud over the State of Utah.\\n\\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this\\norganization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and\\nyet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church\\nvanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His\\nwife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell\\nthem how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty\\nact was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of\\nthis terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went\\nabout in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they\\ndared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\\n\\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to\\npervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of\\nadult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on\\nwhich to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied\\nabout—rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where\\nIndians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the\\nElders—women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of\\nan unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs\\nof armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the\\ndarkness. These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were\\ncorroborated and re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a\\ndefinite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the\\nDanite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\\n\\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results\\nserved to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the\\nminds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of the\\nparticipators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of\\nreligion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated\\nyour misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who\\nwould come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation.\\nHence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\\nnearest his heart.\\n\\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he\\nheard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout,\\nsandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his\\nmouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of\\ntrepidation—for he knew that such a visit boded him little\\ngood—Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter,\\nhowever, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face\\ninto the sitting-room.\\n\\n“Brother Ferrier,” he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from\\nunder his light-coloured eyelashes, “the true believers have been good friends\\nto you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our\\nfood with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of\\nland, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?”\\n\\n“It is so,” answered John Ferrier.\\n\\n“In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should\\nembrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you\\npromised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected.”\\n\\n“And how have I neglected it?” asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\\nexpostulation. “Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at the\\nTemple? Have I not——?”\\n\\n“Where are your wives?” asked Young, looking round him. “Call them in, that I\\nmay greet them.”\\n\\n“It is true that I have not married,” Ferrier answered. “But women were few,\\nand there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man: I had\\nmy daughter to attend to my wants.”\\n\\n“It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,” said the leader of the\\nMormons. “She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the\\neyes of many who are high in the land.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier groaned internally.\\n\\n“There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve—stories that she\\nis sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the\\nthirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? ‘Let every maiden of\\nthe true faith marry one of the elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a\\ngrievous sin.’ This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy\\ncreed, should suffer your daughter to violate it.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his riding-whip.\\n\\n“Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested—so it has been\\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have\\nher wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have\\nmany heifers,[1] but our\\nchildren must also be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son,\\nand either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her\\nchoose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\\nyou to that?”\\n\\n [1]\\nHeber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred wives under\\nthis endearing epithet.\\n\\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\\n\\n“You will give us time,” he said at last. “My daughter is very young—she\\nis scarce of an age to marry.”\\n\\n“She shall have a month to choose,” said Young, rising from his seat. “At the\\nend of that time she shall give her answer.”\\n\\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and flashing\\neyes. “It were better for you, John Ferrier,” he thundered, “that you and she\\nwere now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should\\nput your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!”\\n\\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and Ferrier\\nheard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\\n\\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he should\\nbroach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his, and\\nlooking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her pale, frightened\\nface showed him that she had heard what had passed.\\n\\n“I could not help it,” she said, in answer to his look. “His voice rang through\\nthe house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?”\\n\\n“Don’t you scare yourself,” he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his\\nbroad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. “We’ll fix it up somehow\\nor another. You don’t find your fancy kind o’ lessening for this chap, do you?”\\n\\nA sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\\n\\n“No; of course not. I shouldn’t care to hear you say you did. He’s a likely\\nlad, and he’s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o’ all\\ntheir praying and preaching. There’s a party starting for Nevada to-morrow, and\\nI’ll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I\\nknow anything o’ that young man, he’ll be back here with a speed that would\\nwhip electro-telegraphs.”\\n\\nLucy laughed through her tears at her father’s description.\\n\\n“When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I am\\nfrightened, dear. One hears—one hears such dreadful stories about those\\nwho oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to them.”\\n\\n“But we haven’t opposed him yet,” her father answered. “It will be time to look\\nout for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at the end of\\nthat, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.”\\n\\n“Leave Utah!”\\n\\n“That’s about the size of it.”\\n\\n“But the farm?”\\n\\n“We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the\\ntruth, Lucy, it isn’t the first time I have thought of doing it. I don’t care\\nabout knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet. I’m\\na free-born American, and it’s all new to me. Guess I’m too old to learn. If he\\ncomes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of\\nbuckshot travelling in the opposite direction.”\\n\\n“But they won’t let us leave,” his daughter objected.\\n\\n“Wait till Jefferson comes, and we’ll soon manage that. In the meantime, don’t\\nyou fret yourself, my dearie, and don’t get your eyes swelled up, else he’ll be\\nwalking into me when he sees you. There’s nothing to be afeared about, and\\nthere’s no danger at all.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she\\ncould not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the\\ndoors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old\\nshotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nOn the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John\\nFerrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his acquaintance, who was\\nbound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson\\nHope. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them,\\nand how necessary it was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier\\nin his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart.\\n\\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of\\nthe posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering to find two\\nyoung men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a long pale face, was\\nleaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The\\nother, a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front\\nof the window with his hands in his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of\\nthem nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair\\ncommenced the conversation.\\n\\n“Maybe you don’t know us,” he said. “This here is the son of Elder Drebber, and\\nI’m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord\\nstretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold.”\\n\\n“As He will all the nations in His own good time,” said the other in a nasal\\nvoice; “He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\\n\\n“We have come,” continued Stangerson, “at the advice of our fathers to solicit\\nthe hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her.\\nAs I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me\\nthat my claim is the stronger one.”\\n\\n“Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,” cried the other; “the question is not how many\\nwives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills\\nto me, and I am the richer man.”\\n\\n“But my prospects are better,” said the other, warmly. “When the Lord removes\\nmy father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am\\nyour elder, and am higher in the Church.”\\n\\n“It will be for the maiden to decide,” rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his\\nown reflection in the glass. “We will leave it all to her decision.”\\n\\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able\\nto keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\\n\\n“Look here,” he said at last, striding up to them, “when my daughter summons\\nyou, you can come, but until then I don’t want to see your faces again.”\\n\\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\\ncompetition between them for the maiden’s hand was the highest of honours both\\nto her and her father.\\n\\n“There are two ways out of the room,” cried Ferrier; “there is the door, and\\nthere is the window. Which do you care to use?”\\n\\nHis brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his\\nvisitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old farmer\\nfollowed them to the door.\\n\\n“Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,” he said, sardonically.\\n\\n“You shall smart for this!” Stangerson cried, white with rage. “You have defied\\nthe Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days.”\\n\\n“The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,” cried young Drebber; “He will\\narise and smite you!”\\n\\n“Then I’ll start the smiting,” exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have\\nrushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained\\nhim. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses’ hoofs told him\\nthat they were beyond his reach.\\n\\n“The young canting rascals!” he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his\\nforehead; “I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of\\neither of them.”\\n\\n“And so should I, father,” she answered, with spirit; “but Jefferson will soon\\nbe here.”\\n\\n“Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not\\nknow what their next move may be.”\\n\\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should\\ncome to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. In the whole\\nhistory of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience\\nto the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were punished so sternly, what\\nwould be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position\\nwould be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had\\nbeen spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was\\na brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him.\\nAny known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was\\nunnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to\\nmake light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw\\nplainly that he was ill at ease.\\n\\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to\\nhis conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner.\\nUpon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper\\npinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in\\nbold straggling letters:—\\n\\n“Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then——”\\n\\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this\\nwarning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept\\nin an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He crumpled the\\npaper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into\\nhis heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which\\nYoung had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed\\nwith such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\\n\\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast\\nwhen Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling\\nwas scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it\\nwas unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his\\ngun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the\\nmorning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door.\\n\\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen\\nenemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position\\nhow many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the\\nfatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally\\nthey were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With\\nall his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings\\nproceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight\\nof them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of\\nsome hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the\\narrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\\n\\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the\\nabsentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of\\nhim. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his\\nteam, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at\\nlast. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he\\nlost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his\\nlimited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew\\nthat he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and\\nguarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn\\nwhich way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over\\nhim. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself\\nbefore he consented to what he regarded as his daughter’s dishonour.\\n\\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and\\nsearching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2\\nupon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted\\ntime. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled\\nhis imagination. And his daughter—what was to become of her after he was\\ngone? Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round\\nthem. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own\\nimpotence.\\n\\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound—low, but\\nvery distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house.\\nFerrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few\\nmoments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently\\ntapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight\\nassassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal?\\nOr was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived.\\nJohn Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which\\nshook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and\\nthrew the door open.\\n\\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer’s\\neyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any\\nhuman being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to\\nleft, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his\\nastonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs\\nall asprawl.\\n\\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his\\nhand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first thought was\\nthat the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he\\nwatched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the\\nrapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang\\nto his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce\\nface and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.\\n\\n“Good God!” gasped John Ferrier. “How you scared me! Whatever made you come in\\nlike that.”\\n\\n“Give me food,” the other said, hoarsely. “I have had no time for bite or sup\\nfor eight-and-forty hours.” He flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which\\nwere still lying upon the table from his host’s supper, and devoured it\\nvoraciously. “Does Lucy bear up well?” he asked, when he had satisfied his\\nhunger.\\n\\n“Yes. She does not know the danger,” her father answered.\\n\\n“That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my way\\nup to it. They may be darned sharp, but they’re not quite sharp enough to catch\\na Washoe hunter.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted\\nally. He seized the young man’s leathery hand and wrung it cordially. “You’re a\\nman to be proud of,” he said. “There are not many who would come to share our\\ndanger and our troubles.”\\n\\n“You’ve hit it there, pard,” the young hunter answered. “I have a respect for\\nyou, but if you were alone in this business I’d think twice before I put my\\nhead into such a hornet’s nest. It’s Lucy that brings me here, and before harm\\ncomes on her I guess there will be one less o’ the Hope family in Utah.”\\n\\n“What are we to do?”\\n\\n“To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost. I have a\\nmule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you?”\\n\\n“Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.”\\n\\n“That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City\\nthrough the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants\\ndo not sleep in the house.”\\n\\nWhile Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey,\\nJefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel,\\nand filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the\\nmountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly completed his\\narrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready\\nfor a start. The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes\\nwere precious, and there was much to be done.\\n\\n“We must make our start at once,” said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but\\nresolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has\\nsteeled his heart to meet it. “The front and back entrances are watched, but\\nwith caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields.\\nOnce on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are\\nwaiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains.”\\n\\n“What if we are stopped,” asked Ferrier.\\n\\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic. “If\\nthey are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us,” he said\\nwith a sinister smile.\\n\\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened\\nwindow Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and which he was\\nnow about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice,\\nhowever, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed\\nany regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the\\nrustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was\\ndifficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the\\nwhite face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach\\nto the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\\n\\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty\\nprovisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her\\nmore valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they\\nwaited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one\\npassed through into the little garden. With bated breath and crouching figures\\nthey stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they\\nskirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had\\njust reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and\\ndragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\\n\\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a\\nlynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting\\nof a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately\\nanswered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague\\nshadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered\\nthe plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the\\nobscurity.\\n\\n“To-morrow at midnight,” said the first who appeared to be in authority. “When\\nthe Whip-poor-Will calls three times.”\\n\\n“It is well,” returned the other. “Shall I tell Brother Drebber?”\\n\\n“Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!”\\n\\n“Seven to five!” repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in\\ndifferent directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of\\nsign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the\\ndistance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through\\nthe gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and\\nhalf-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her.\\n\\n“Hurry on! hurry on!” he gasped from time to time. “We are through the line of\\nsentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!”\\n\\nOnce on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet anyone,\\nand then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition. Before\\nreaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath\\nwhich led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the\\ndarkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Cañon in which\\nthe horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his\\nway among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until\\nhe came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals\\nhad been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one\\nof the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the\\nprecipitous and dangerous path.\\n\\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in\\nher wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or\\nmore, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged\\nsurface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos\\nof boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the\\nirregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file,\\nand so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in\\nspite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light\\nwithin them, for every step increased the distance between them and the\\nterrible despotism from which they were flying.\\n\\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of\\nthe Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the\\npass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which\\noverlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a\\nsolitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military\\nchallenge of “Who goes there?” rang through the silent ravine.\\n\\n“Travellers for Nevada,” said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle\\nwhich hung by his saddle.\\n\\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them\\nas if dissatisfied at their reply.\\n\\n“By whose permission?” he asked.\\n\\n“The Holy Four,” answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that\\nthat was the highest authority to which he could refer.\\n\\n“Nine from seven,” cried the sentinel.\\n\\n“Seven from five,” returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.\\n\\n“Pass, and the Lord go with you,” said the voice from above. Beyond his post\\nthe path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot. Looking\\nback, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun, and knew that\\nthey had passed the outlying post of the chosen people, and that freedom lay\\nbefore them.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nAll night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and\\nrock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope’s intimate\\nknowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When\\nmorning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In\\nevery direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each\\nother’s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either\\nside of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their\\nheads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was\\nthe fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with\\ntrees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a\\ngreat rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in\\nthe silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop.\\n\\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were\\nall ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the\\nthree fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out\\nof a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of\\na hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but\\nJefferson Hope was inexorable. “They will be upon our track by this time,” he\\nsaid. “Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for\\nthe remainder of our lives.”\\n\\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by\\nevening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their\\nenemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks\\noffered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for\\nwarmth, they enjoyed a few hours’ sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up\\nand on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and\\nJefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the\\nterrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far\\nthat iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush\\nthem.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of\\nprovisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however,\\nfor there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before\\nhad to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook,\\nhe piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his\\ncompanions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet\\nabove the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the\\nhorses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in\\nsearch of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old\\nman and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals\\nstood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from\\nhis view.\\n\\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without\\nsuccess, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other\\nindications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last,\\nafter two or three hours’ fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in\\ndespair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of\\npleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four\\nhundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in\\nappearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn—for so\\nit is called—was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were\\ninvisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite\\ndirection, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle\\nupon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The\\nanimal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the\\nprecipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.\\n\\nThe creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with\\ncutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his\\nshoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing\\nin. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which\\nfaced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were\\nknown to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had\\ntaken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many\\ngorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one\\nfrom the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain\\ntorrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had\\ntaken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was\\ncoming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a\\ndefile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to\\nthe right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either\\nside made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary\\nfrom his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection\\nthat every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough\\nto ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.\\n\\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even\\nin the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it.\\nThey must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent\\nnearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth\\nand made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He\\npaused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered\\nup the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless\\nrepetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper\\ncame back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague,\\nnameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the\\nprecious food in his agitation.\\n\\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had\\nbeen lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had\\nevidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still\\nreigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on.\\nThere was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man,\\nmaiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible\\ndisaster had occurred during his absence—a disaster which had embraced\\nthem all, and yet had left no traces behind it.\\n\\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round,\\nand had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially\\na man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence.\\nSeizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it\\ninto a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The\\nground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party\\nof mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks\\nproved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried\\nback both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded\\nhimself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which\\nmade every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the\\ncamp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there\\nbefore. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the\\nyoung hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it,\\nwith a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the\\npaper was brief, but to the point:\\n\\n\\nJOHN FERRIER,\\nFORMERLY OF SALT LAKE\\nCITY,\\nDied August 4th, 1860.\\n\\nThe sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then,\\nand this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if\\nthere was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried\\nback by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one\\nof the harem of the Elder’s son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of\\nher fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was\\nlying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place.\\n\\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from\\ndespair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his\\nlife to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope\\npossessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned\\nfrom the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire,\\nhe felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough\\nand complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong\\nwill and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end.\\nWith a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the\\nfood, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him\\nfor a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set\\nhimself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging\\nangels.\\n\\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had\\nalready traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks,\\nand snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on\\nhis way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Cañon, from which they had\\ncommenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of\\nthe saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt\\nhand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he\\nobserved that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other\\nsigns of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\\nheard the clatter of horse’s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him.\\nAs he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had\\nrendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up\\nto him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier’s fate had been.\\n\\n“I am Jefferson Hope,” he said. “You remember me.”\\n\\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment—indeed, it was\\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white\\nface and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. Having,\\nhowever, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity, the man’s surprise\\nchanged to consternation.\\n\\n“You are mad to come here,” he cried. “It is as much as my own life is worth to\\nbe seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for\\nassisting the Ferriers away.”\\n\\n“I don’t fear them, or their warrant,” Hope said, earnestly. “You must know\\nsomething of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to\\nanswer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God’s sake, don’t\\nrefuse to answer me.”\\n\\n“What is it?” the Mormon asked uneasily. “Be quick. The very rocks have ears\\nand the trees eyes.”\\n\\n“What has become of Lucy Ferrier?”\\n\\n“She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no\\nlife left in you.”\\n\\n“Don’t mind me,” said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk\\ndown on the stone against which he had been leaning. “Married, you say?”\\n\\n“Married yesterday—that’s what those flags are for on the Endowment\\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to\\nwhich was to have her. They’d both been in the party that followed them, and\\nStangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but\\nwhen they argued it out in council, Drebber’s party was the stronger, so the\\nProphet gave her over to him. No one won’t have her very long though, for I saw\\ndeath in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you\\noff, then?”\\n\\n“Yes, I am off,” said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face\\nmight have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression,\\nwhile its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\\n\\n“Where are you going?”\\n\\n“Never mind,” he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode\\noff down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of\\nthe wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as\\nhimself.\\n\\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the\\nterrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which\\nshe had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and\\ndied within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for\\nthe sake of John Ferrier’s property, did not affect any great grief at his\\nbereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the\\nnight before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the\\nbier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and\\nastonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man\\nin tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the\\ncowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once\\ncontained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips\\nreverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the\\nwedding-ring from her finger. “She shall not be buried in that,” he cried with\\na fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and\\nwas gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have\\nfound it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it\\nnot been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as\\nhaving been a bride had disappeared.\\n\\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange\\nwild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which\\npossessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen\\nprowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once\\na bullet whistled through Stangerson’s window and flattened itself upon the\\nwall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff\\na great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by\\nthrowing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated\\nexpeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy,\\nbut always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out\\nalone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they\\nwere able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of\\ntheir opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\\n\\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter’s mind was of\\na hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such\\ncomplete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was,\\nhowever, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron\\nconstitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it.\\nExposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog\\namong the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a\\ndeath was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play\\nhis enemy’s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to\\nrecruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object\\nwithout privation.\\n\\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of\\nunforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At\\nthe end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for\\nrevenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John\\nFerrier’s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake\\nCity, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew\\nto be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members\\nof the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the\\nresult had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had\\nleft Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and\\nno one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to\\nconvert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a\\nwealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was\\nno clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts.\\n\\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in\\nthe face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment.\\nWith the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could\\npick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of\\nhis enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still\\nhe wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one\\nobject upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was\\nrewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told\\nhim that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It\\nchanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the\\nvagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a\\njustice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private\\nsecretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from\\nthe jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken\\ninto custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks.\\nWhen at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber’s house was\\ndeserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.\\n\\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him\\nto continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he had\\nto return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching journey. At last,\\nhaving collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and\\ntracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity,\\nbut never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had\\ndeparted for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had\\njust set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days\\nlate, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in\\nrunning them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than\\nquote the old hunter’s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson’s Journal,\\nto which we are already under such obligations.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nOur prisoner’s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in\\nhis disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled\\nin an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in\\nthe scuffle. “I guess you’re going to take me to the police-station,” he\\nremarked to Sherlock Holmes. “My cab’s at the door. If you’ll loose my legs\\nI’ll walk down to it. I’m not so light to lift as I used to be.”\\n\\nGregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition\\nrather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and\\nloosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles. He rose and stretched\\nhis legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more. I remember\\nthat I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more\\npowerfully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of\\ndetermination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.\\n\\n“If there’s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man\\nfor it,” he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. “The\\nway you kept on my trail was a caution.”\\n\\n“You had better come with me,” said Holmes to the two detectives.\\n\\n“I can drive you,” said Lestrade.\\n\\n“Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an\\ninterest in the case and may as well stick to us.”\\n\\nI assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt\\nat escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed\\nhim. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very\\nshort time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a\\npolice Inspector noted down our prisoner’s name and the names of the men with\\nwhose murder he had been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional\\nman, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. “The prisoner will\\nbe put before the magistrates in the course of the week,” he said; “in the mean\\ntime, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn\\nyou that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.”\\n\\n“I’ve got a good deal to say,” our prisoner said slowly. “I want to tell you\\ngentlemen all about it.”\\n\\n“Hadn’t you better reserve that for your trial?” asked the Inspector.\\n\\n“I may never be tried,” he answered. “You needn’t look startled. It isn’t\\nsuicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?” He turned his fierce dark eyes\\nupon me as he asked this last question.\\n\\n“Yes; I am,” I answered.\\n\\n“Then put your hand here,” he said, with a smile, motioning with his manacled\\nwrists towards his chest.\\n\\nI did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and\\ncommotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill\\nand quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at\\nwork. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise\\nwhich proceeded from the same source.\\n\\n“Why,” I cried, “you have an aortic aneurism!”\\n\\n“That’s what they call it,” he said, placidly. “I went to a Doctor last week\\nabout it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed. It\\nhas been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding\\namong the Salt Lake Mountains. I’ve done my work now, and I don’t care how soon\\nI go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. I\\ndon’t want to be remembered as a common cut-throat.”\\n\\nThe Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.\\n\\n“Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?” the former asked.\\n\\n“Most certainly there is,” I answered.\\n\\n“In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his\\nstatement,” said the Inspector. “You are at liberty, sir, to give your account,\\nwhich I again warn you will be taken down.”\\n\\n“I’ll sit down, with your leave,” the prisoner said, suiting the action to the\\nword. “This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half\\nan hour ago has not mended matters. I’m on the brink of the grave, and I am not\\nlikely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you use\\nit is a matter of no consequence to me.”\\n\\nWith these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the\\nfollowing remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as\\nthough the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can vouch for\\nthe accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade’s\\nnote-book, in which the prisoner’s words were taken down exactly as they were\\nuttered.\\n\\n“It don’t much matter to you why I hated these men,” he said; “it’s enough that\\nthey were guilty of the death of two human beings—a father and a\\ndaughter—and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. After\\nthe lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me\\nto secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though,\\nand I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into\\none. You’d have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been\\nin my place.\\n\\n“That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She was\\nforced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took the\\nmarriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest\\nupon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for\\nwhich he was punished. I have carried it about with me, and have followed him\\nand his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to\\ntire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough,\\nI die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have\\nperished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to\\ndesire.\\n\\n“They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow\\nthem. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must\\nturn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to\\nme as walking, so I applied at a cabowner’s office, and soon got employment. I\\nwas to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I\\nmight keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape\\nalong somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of\\nall the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had\\na map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and\\nstations, I got on pretty well.\\n\\n“It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I\\ninquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a\\nboarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I\\nfound them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and\\nthere was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them\\nuntil I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me\\nagain.\\n\\n“They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I\\nwas always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes\\non foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me.\\nIt was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything,\\nso that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that,\\nhowever, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.\\n\\n“They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some\\nchance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never\\nafter nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once\\nsaw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was\\nnot to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but never saw the\\nghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the\\nhour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst\\na little too soon and leave my work undone.\\n\\n“At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street\\nwas called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door.\\nPresently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson\\nfollowed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of\\nthem, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift\\ntheir quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my\\nhorse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool\\ntrain, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be\\nanother for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber\\nwas rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I\\ncould hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a\\nlittle business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he\\nwould soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him\\nthat they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was\\na delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson\\nsaid to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was\\nnothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to\\nhim. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with\\nhim that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday’s Private\\nHotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before\\neleven, and made his way out of the station.\\n\\n“The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies\\nwithin my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were\\nat my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were\\nalready formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has\\ntime to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon\\nhim. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making\\nthe man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It\\nchanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over\\nsome houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my\\ncarriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I\\nhad taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I\\nhad access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon\\nbeing free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the\\ndifficult problem which I had now to solve.\\n\\n“He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for\\nnearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his\\nwalk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me,\\nand he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a\\nyard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through\\nmiles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the\\nTerrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in\\nreturning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from\\nthe house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water,\\nif you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.”\\n\\nI handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\\n\\n“That’s better,” he said. “Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more,\\nwhen suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next\\nmoment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber,\\nand the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had\\nDrebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him\\na shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. ‘You hound,’ he cried,\\nshaking his stick at him; ‘I’ll teach you to insult an honest girl!’ He was so\\nhot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the\\ncur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as\\nfar as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. ‘Drive\\nme to Halliday’s Private Hotel,’ said he.\\n\\n“When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared\\nlest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly,\\nweighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into\\nthe country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. I\\nhad almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for\\ndrink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace.\\nHe went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until\\nclosing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was\\nin my own hands.\\n\\n“Don’t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have\\nbeen rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I\\nhad long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take\\nadvantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America during\\nmy wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York\\nCollege. One day the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his\\nstudents some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South\\nAmerican arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant\\ninstant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and\\nwhen they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good\\ndispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I\\nput in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the\\ntime that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one\\nof these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as\\ndeadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that\\nday I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I\\nwas to use them.\\n\\n“It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and\\nraining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within—so glad\\nthat I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen\\nhave ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and\\nthen suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I\\nlit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling,\\nand my temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John\\nFerrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me,\\njust as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me,\\none on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton\\nRoad.\\n\\n“There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping\\nof the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled\\ntogether in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, ‘It’s time to get out,’ I\\nsaid.\\n\\n“‘All right, cabby,’ said he.\\n\\n“I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he\\ngot out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk\\nbeside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we\\ncame to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my\\nword that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.\\n\\n“‘It’s infernally dark,’ said he, stamping about.\\n\\n“‘We’ll soon have a light,’ I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax\\ncandle which I had brought with me. ‘Now, Enoch Drebber,’ I continued, turning\\nto him, and holding the light to my own face, ‘who am I?’\\n\\n“He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a\\nhorror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that\\nhe knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration\\nbreak out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, I\\nleaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known\\nthat vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of\\nsoul which now possessed me.\\n\\n“‘You dog!’ I said; ‘I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg,\\nand you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an\\nend, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow’s sun rise.’ He shrunk still\\nfurther away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad.\\nSo I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I\\nbelieve I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my\\nnose and relieved me.\\n\\n“‘What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?’ I cried, locking the door, and\\nshaking the key in his face. ‘Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has\\novertaken you at last.’ I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would have\\nbegged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.\\n\\n“‘Would you murder me?’ he stammered.\\n\\n“‘There is no murder,’ I answered. ‘Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What\\nmercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered\\nfather, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem.’\\n\\n“‘It was not I who killed her father,’ he cried.\\n\\n“‘But it was you who broke her innocent heart,’ I shrieked, thrusting the box\\nbefore him. ‘Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death\\nin one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there\\nis justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.’\\n\\n“He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and\\nheld it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other, and\\nwe stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see\\nwhich was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came\\nover his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his\\nsystem? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy’s marriage ring in front of his\\neyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm\\nof pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned\\nhim over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no\\nmovement. He was dead!\\n\\n“The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I\\ndon’t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it.\\nPerhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track,\\nfor I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New\\nYork with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the\\nnewspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what\\npuzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my\\nown blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down\\nto my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still\\nvery wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in\\nwhich I usually kept Lucy’s ring, and found that it was not there. I was\\nthunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking\\nthat I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber’s body, I drove back,\\nand leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house—for I\\nwas ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I\\nwalked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only\\nmanaged to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\\n\\n“That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as\\nmuch for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier’s debt. I knew that he was\\nstaying at Halliday’s Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never\\ncame out. I fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an\\nappearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he\\nthought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I\\nsoon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I\\ntook advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel,\\nand so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and\\ntold him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken\\nso long before. I described Drebber’s death to him, and I gave him the same\\nchoice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which\\nthat offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In self-defence\\nI stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in any case, for\\nProvidence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but\\nthe poison.\\n\\n“I have little more to say, and it’s as well, for I am about done up. I went on\\ncabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough\\nto take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster\\nasked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab\\nwas wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no\\nharm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my\\nwrists, and as neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That’s the whole of my\\nstory, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am\\njust as much an officer of justice as you are.”\\n\\nSo thrilling had the man’s narrative been, and his manner was so impressive\\nthat we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional detectives,\\nblasé as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly\\ninterested in the man’s story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a\\nstillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade’s pencil as he\\ngave the finishing touches to his shorthand account.\\n\\n“There is only one point on which I should like a little more information,”\\nSherlock Holmes said at last. “Who was your accomplice who came for the ring\\nwhich I advertised?”\\n\\nThe prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. “I can tell my own secrets,” he\\nsaid, “but I don’t get other people into trouble. I saw your advertisement, and\\nI thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted. My\\nfriend volunteered to go and see. I think you’ll own he did it smartly.”\\n\\n“Not a doubt of that,” said Holmes heartily.\\n\\n“Now, gentlemen,” the Inspector remarked gravely, “the forms of the law must be\\ncomplied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates,\\nand your attendance will be required. Until then I will be responsible for\\nhim.” He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple\\nof warders, while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a\\ncab back to Baker Street.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nWe had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday; but\\nwhen the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony. A higher Judge\\nhad taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a\\ntribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him. On the very night\\nafter his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched\\nupon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had\\nbeen able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work\\nwell done.\\n\\n“Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,” Holmes remarked, as we\\nchatted it over next evening. “Where will their grand advertisement be now?”\\n\\n“I don’t see that they had very much to do with his capture,” I answered.\\n\\n“What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,” returned my\\ncompanion, bitterly. “The question is, what can you make people believe that\\nyou have done. Never mind,” he continued, more brightly, after a pause. “I\\nwould not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better\\ncase within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most\\ninstructive points about it.”\\n\\n“Simple!” I ejaculated.\\n\\n“Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,” said Sherlock Holmes,\\nsmiling at my surprise. “The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without\\nany help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the\\ncriminal within three days.”\\n\\n“That is true,” said I.\\n\\n“I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a\\nguide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand\\nthing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment,\\nand a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the every-day\\naffairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to\\nbe neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can\\nreason analytically.”\\n\\n“I confess,” said I, “that I do not quite follow you.”\\n\\n“I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most\\npeople, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the\\nresult would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue\\nfrom them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who,\\nif you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner\\nconsciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is\\nwhat I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.”\\n\\n“I understand,” said I.\\n\\n“Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find\\neverything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the different\\nsteps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as\\nyou know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I\\nnaturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already\\nexplained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by\\ninquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was\\na cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The\\nordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman’s brougham.\\n\\n“This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path,\\nwhich happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking\\nimpressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush,\\nbut to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no\\nbranch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the\\nart of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and\\nmuch practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed\\nthrough the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others,\\nbecause in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others\\ncoming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told\\nme that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his\\nheight (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other\\nfashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his\\nboots.\\n\\n“On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man\\nlay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was.\\nThere was no wound upon the dead man’s person, but the agitated expression upon\\nhis face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men\\nwho die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance\\nexhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man’s lips I\\ndetected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had\\npoison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from\\nthe hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had\\narrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not\\nimagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible administration of\\npoison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in\\nOdessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.\\n\\n“And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the\\nobject of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a\\nwoman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first\\nto the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their\\nwork and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately,\\nand the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had\\nbeen there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was\\ndiscovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing\\nwas too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the\\nquestion. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or\\nabsent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired\\nin his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber’s former\\ncareer. He answered, you remember, in the negative.\\n\\n“I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me\\nin my opinion as to the murderer’s height, and furnished me with the additional\\ndetails as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already\\ncome to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood\\nwhich covered the floor had burst from the murderer’s nose in his excitement. I\\ncould perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It\\nis seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way\\nthrough emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a\\nrobust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.\\n\\n“Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the\\ncircumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was\\nconclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of\\nthe law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same\\nHope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery\\nin my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer.\\n\\n“I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the\\nhouse with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The\\nmarks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would\\nhave been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could\\nthe driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose\\nthat any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it\\nwere, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man\\nwished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to\\nturn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion\\nthat Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.\\n\\n“If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be. On\\nthe contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw\\nattention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue to\\nperform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an\\nassumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his\\noriginal one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent\\nthem systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out\\nthe man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took\\nadvantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson\\nwas an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any\\ncase have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of\\nthe pills, the existence of which I had already surmised. You see the whole\\nthing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.”\\n\\n“It is wonderful!” I cried. “Your merits should be publicly recognized. You\\nshould publish an account of the case. If you won’t, I will for you.”\\n\\n“You may do what you like, Doctor,” he answered. “See here!” he continued,\\nhanding a paper over to me, “look at this!”\\n\\nIt was the Echo for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was\\ndevoted to the case in question.\\n\\n“The public,” it said, “have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death\\nof the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of\\nMr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will probably be never known\\nnow, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result\\nof an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part.\\nIt seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter\\nDay Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If\\nthe case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking\\nmanner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson\\nto all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and\\nnot to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit of\\nthis smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials,\\nMessrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms\\nof a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some\\ntalent in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time\\nto attain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of\\nsome sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of\\ntheir services.”\\n\\n“Didn’t I tell you so when we started?” cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh.\\n“That’s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial!”\\n\\n“Never mind,” I answered, “I have all the facts in my journal, and the public\\nshall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the\\nconsciousness of success, like the Roman miser—\\n\\n\\n“‘Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\\nIpse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.’”\\n',\n",

       "'In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University ofLondon, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed forsurgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached tothe Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment wasstationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghanwar had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advancedthrough the passes, and was already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed,however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, andsucceeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and atonce entered upon my new duties.The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothingbut misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to theBerkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I wasstruck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazedthe subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderousGhazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, myorderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safelyto the British lines.Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, Iwas removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital atPeshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walkabout the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struckdown by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my lifewas despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, Iwas so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day shouldbe lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in thetroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with myhealth irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government tospend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air—or asfree as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man tobe. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that greatcesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistiblydrained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leadinga comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had,considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my financesbecome, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis andrusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alterationin my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up mymind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentiousand less expensive domicile.On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at theCriterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round Irecognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sightof a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeedto a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony ofmine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to bedelighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with meat the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in undisguisedwonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. “You are as thin as alath and as brown as a nut.”I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by thetime that we reached our destination.“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to mymisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to whetherit is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man to-daythat has used that expression to me.”“And who was the first?” I asked.“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He wasbemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halveswith him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for hispurse.”“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and theexpense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to beingalone.”Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You don’tknow Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care for him as aconstant companion.”“Why, what is there against him?”“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in hisideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is adecent fellow enough.”“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well upin anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he hasnever taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultoryand eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which wouldastonish his professors.”“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can becommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I shouldprefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to standmuch noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me forthe remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?”“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either avoidsthe place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like,we shall drive round together after luncheon.”“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave mea few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as afellow-lodger.“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know nothingmore of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in thelaboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold meresponsible.”“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It seems tome, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you have somereason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s temper soformidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a laugh.“Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches tocold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of thelatest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simplyout of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. Todo him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness.He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.”“Very right too.”“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects inthe dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarreshape.”“Beating the subjects!”“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at itwith my own eyes.”“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and youmust form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we turned down a narrowlane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of thegreat hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as weascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor withits vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end alow arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, lowtables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, andlittle Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only onestudent in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work.At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry ofpleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve found it,” he shouted to my companion, runningtowards us with a test-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which isprecipitated by hæmoglobin, and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a goldmine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which Ishould hardly have given him credit. “You have been in Afghanistan, Iperceive.”“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is abouthæmoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?”“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “butpractically——”“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don’t yousee that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!”He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the tableat which he had been working. “Let us have some fresh blood,” he said, digginga long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in achemical pipette. “Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water.You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. Theproportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt,however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.” As hespoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some dropsof a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahoganycolour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a childwith a new toy. “What do you think of that?”“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. Sois the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless ifthe stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether theblood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men nowwalking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”“Indeed!” I murmured.“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspectedof a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes areexamined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, ormud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is aquestion which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was noreliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longerbe any difficulty.”His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart andbowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at hisenthusiasm.“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainlyhave been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason ofBradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson ofNew Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have beendecisive.”“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a laugh. “Youmight start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News of the Past.’”“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock Holmes,sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. “I have to becareful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for I dabble with poisonsa good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was allmottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-leggedstool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. “My friend herewants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no oneto go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.”Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. “Ihave my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would suit us down tothe ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?”“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally doexperiments. Would that annoy you?”“By no means.”“Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times,and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when Ido that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What have you to confessnow? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another beforethey begin to live together.”I laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and I objectto rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodlyhours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I’m well, butthose are the principal ones at present.”“Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked, anxiously.“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a treat forthe gods—a badly-played one——”“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may considerthe thing as settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.”“When shall we see them?”“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settleeverything,” he answered.“All right—noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards myhotel.“By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, “how thedeuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little peculiarity,”he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.”“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very piquant. I ammuch obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper study of mankind isman,’ you know.”“You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. “You’ll findhim a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more about you than youabout him. Good-bye.”“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested inmy new acquaintance.'"
